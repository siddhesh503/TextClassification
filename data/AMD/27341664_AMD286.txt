To evaluate the risk of stroke after ranibizumab treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
National registry data for 1,025,340 random subjects in the year 2002 were used. The ranibizumab group comprised patients diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and treated with ranibizumab between 2009 and 2013 (n = 467). The two types of comparison groups were defined as comorbidity-matched controls (n = 2,330) comprised of randomly selected patients (5 per age-related macular degeneration patient), who were matched to the ranibizumab group according to sociodemographic factors, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and the Charlson comorbidities index, and sociodemographic-matched controls (n = 2,331) matched according to sociodemographic factors only. Each sampled patient was tracked until 2013. The Cox proportional hazard regression was used.
Stroke occurred in 6.6% of the ranibizumab group versus 7.0% of the comorbidity-matched controls and 6.7% of the sociodemographic-matched controls; these differences were not statistically significant. The overall incidence of stroke was similar for the ranibizumab group versus the comorbidity-matched controls and sociodemographic-matched controls, based on the multivariable Cox regression (hazard ratio = 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.30; hazard ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.41, respectively).
Ranibizumab treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration did not increase the overall risk of stroke, compared with comorbidity-matched controls or sociodemographic-matched controls.
