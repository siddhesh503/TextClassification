To evaluate the role of a fast track for management of patients with neovascular age- related macular degeneration (nARMD) treated by intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF.
The records of 100 patients in the chronic maintenance phase of intravitreal anti-VEGF followed in the fast track and 63 patients followed in the standard protocol for at least 12 months were retrospectively analyzed.
Patients in the fast track underwent visual acuity (VA) testing by ETDRS, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and a physician assessment. The injection was performed the same day whenever possible. The primary endpoint to evaluate patient adherence was the time between the ideal date of visit or injection prescribed by the physician and the actual date of administration.
The mean time between the ideal date of visit or injection prescribed by the physician and the actual date of administration was 4.1±7.5 days for the patients followed in the fast track and 5.6±18.7 days for the patients followed in the standard protocol. Mean VA remained stable for the patients followed in the fast track: 20/50 (20/800 to 20/20) at baseline vs. 20/50 (20/800 to 20/16) at the conclusion of follow-up. It dropped from 40/50 at baseline to 20/63 at the conclusion of follow-up for the patients followed in the standard protocol.
In the context of a fast track, it was possible to improve the adherence of nARMD patients and maintain their VA gain or stabilization achieved after the induction phase.
