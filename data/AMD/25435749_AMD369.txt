To investigate 12-month treatment outcomes of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in eyes with typical exudative age-related macular degeneration with good baseline visual acuity.
This retrospective observational case series included 18 eyes (18 patients) with typical exudative age-related macular degeneration with a baseline best-corrected visual acuity of 20 / 25 or better. Patients were treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monotherapy during the 12-month follow-up period. Baseline visual acuity and central foveal thickness were compared to the values at 12 months.
Patients received an average of 4.4 ± 1.3 intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections. The mean logarithm of minimum angle of resolution visual acuity was 0.08 ± 0.04, 0.08 ± 0.07, 0.12 ± 0.09, and 0.16 ± 0.11 at baseline, three months, six months, and 12 months, respectively. Visual acuity at 12 months was significantly worse than the baseline value at diagnosis (p = 0.017), and the mean central foveal thickness at the defined time points was 270.2 ± 55.6, 204.4 ± 25.4, 230.1 ± 56.3, and 216.8 ± 48.7 µm, respectively. The central foveal thickness at 12 months was significantly less than the baseline value at diagnosis (p = 0.042).
Deterioration in visual acuity was noted in eyes with typical exudative age-related macular degeneration with good baseline visual acuity, suggesting the need for close patient monitoring and prompt treatment even in patients with good baseline visual acuity.
