To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal therapies in cases of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with subretinal or intraretinal fluid.
A retrospective review was made of the clinical charts of patients diagnosed with atrophic AMD with subretinal or intraretinal fluid. Fundus photographs and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images were examined, and an analysis was made on the presence of fluid and its density. Neovascularisation was ruled out by fluorescein and/or indocyanine green angiography.
The study included 14 eyes from 13 patients with a mean age of 72.64 years and a mean follow-up of 80.5 weeks. Intraretinal fluid was observed in 6 eyes (42.9%), while subretinal fluid was shown in 8 eyes (57.1%), with high density in 4 eyes (28.5%), and low density in 4 eyes (28.5%). Snellen best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.37 at baseline to 0.56 at the final visit (P=.002). Central subfield thickness (microns) significantly decreased (P<.001) from 291.0 at baseline to 228.9 at the final visit. Eight eyes received ranibizumab, 5eyes received bevacizumab, and one case received triamcinolone.
Cases of atrophic AMD may present with subretinal or intraretinal fluid in the absence Neovascularisation. Further studies are required to analyse the value of this finding as a risk factor of developing advanced forms of AMD, as well as the efficacy of intravitreal therapies.
