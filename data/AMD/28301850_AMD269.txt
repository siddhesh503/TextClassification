To investigate the effect of vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) on the outcome of antiangiogenic treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Ninety-nine eyes of 83 patients were used in our cohort study. We prospectively evaluated best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) in patients with neovascular AMD at baseline and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. All patients were stratified by spectral domain optical coherence tomography into 2 groups (i.e., VMA[+] and VMA[-]) according to the presence or absence of VMA, and the response to treatment was evaluated.
Fifty-four eyes (54.5%) were included in the VMA(-) group and 45 eyes (45.5%) comprised the VMA(+) group. In paired comparisons of mean BCVA between baseline and each follow-up visit (1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months), the VMA(-) group showed statistically significant improvement at 1, 2, and 3 months compared to baseline, and BCVA significantly improved only at 3 months in the VMA(+) group. For both groups, paired comparisons of CRT showed a statistically significant decrease when data obtained at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared to baseline values (p < 0.05).
Posterior VMA is associated with a worse short-term outcome in patients with neovascular AMD treated with anti-VEGF agents.
