Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition manifesting as visual hallucinations associated with vision impairment in patients without the underlying n euro psychiatric pathologies. As the incidence of age-related macular degeneration is on the rise, we can anticipate increasingly frequent cases of Charles Bonnet syndrome in our patients. The aim of the paper is to present a case of a 75-year-old patient who developed visual hallucinations secondarily to severe bilateral vision impairment due to exudative age-related macular degeneration. Patients with advanced age-related macular degeneration and no history of neuropsychiatric disorders may present with visual hallucinations.
