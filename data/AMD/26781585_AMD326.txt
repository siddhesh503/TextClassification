We aimed to compare changes in subfoveal and peripapillary choroidal thickness (CT) after intravitreal aflibercept or ranibizumab injections for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Medical records of 54 treatment-naïve, consecutive patients (54 eyes) who were diagnosed with neovascular AMD and received three monthly injections of aflibercept (21 eyes) or ranibizumab (33 eyes) were reviewed. Subfoveal and peripapillary CT were measured with images obtained using spectral domain optical coherence tomography at baseline and at three months.
Subfoveal CT decreased from 232.2 ± 94.4 μm at baseline to 207.1 ± 89.3 μm at three months in the aflibercept group (p < 0.001) and from 231.5 ± 102.9 μm to 220.0 ± 98.0 μm in the ranibizumab group (p = 0.006). The reduction was greater in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group (p = 0.024). Peripapillary CT decreased from 157.2 ± 62.2 μm at baseline to 147.4 ± 62.2 μm at three months in the aflibercept group (p < 0.001). However, the change in peripapillary CT from 154.9 ± 46.5 μm at baseline to 152.3 ± 50.0 μm at three months was not significant in the ranibizumab group (p = 0.123).
Intravitreally injected aflibercept significantly decreased subfoveal CT more than ranibizumab. Choroidal thinning after aflibercept injection was not limited to the subfoveal area, but extended beyond the macula as well.
