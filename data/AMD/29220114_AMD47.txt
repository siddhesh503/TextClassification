To compare the 1-year outcomes of treat-and-extend (TAE) and every-other-month (2M) regimens with intravitreal aflibercept in Japanese wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients.
Prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of eyes in which the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was maintained at week 52 [with a loss of <0.3 logarithm of minimum angular of resolution (logMAR) units]. The secondary outcome measures were the mean change from baseline in the central retinal thickness (CRT) and the number of injections.
Forty-one patients were enrolled. The mean changes in the BCVA from baseline in the TAE and 2M were -0.32 ± 0.27 and -0.26 ± 0.30 logMAR units (p = 0.46). The TAE group was noninferior to the 2M group in BCVA maintenance. The mean CRT changes from baseline in the TAE and 2M were -161 ± 133 and -157 ± 90 μm (p = 0.73). The mean number of injections in the TAE and 2M were 7.5 ± 1.2 (range, 7-12) and 8.0 ± 0.0 (p < 0.0001).
Treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen with aflibercept improved the BCVA and CRT to the same extent as 2M regimen, with a reduced number of injections.
