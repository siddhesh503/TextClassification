To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept therapy using a treat-and-extend regimen on treatment-na√Øve pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV) and Type 1 neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
We retrospectively studied 42 eyes with PNV and 60 eyes with Type 1 neovascular AMD. We assessed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), and total number of injections over 2 years.
The BCVA and CMT improvements during the 2-year treatment period did not differ significantly between PNV and AMD; however, CCT decreased significantly in PNV than in AMD (P<0.05). Management of PNV required significantly fewer injections than AMD during the 2-year period (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in BCVA, CMT and CCT changes between PNV with and without polypoidal lesions (28 vs. 14 eyes) during the 2 year period. Significantly fewer injections were needed for PNV with polypoidal lesions than for PNV without (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in BCVA, CMT and CCT changes, or in the number of injections during the 2-year treatment period, between AMD with and without polypoidal lesions (30 vs. 30 eyes).
Treat-and-extend regimen of intravitreal aflibercept injection may be equally effective in terms of improvement of BCVA and exudative changes both in eyes with PNV and those with Type 1 neovascular AMD requiring fewer injections for the former. Among eyes with PNV, those with polypoidal lesions needed fewer injections than those without polypoidal lesions.
