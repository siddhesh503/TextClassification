Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AAMD) is a complex sight-threating disease of public health significance. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as biomarkers for AAMD. The presence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence the explanatory value of these biomarkers. Here we present findings from an integrated approach used to determine whether AAMD-associated SNPs have the capacity to influence miRNA-mRNA pairing and, if so, to what extent such pairing may be manifested in a discrete AAMD transcriptome. Using a panel of 8854 SNPs associated with AAMD at p-values ≤5.0E-7 from a cohort of >30,000 elderly people, we identified SNPs in miRNA target-encoding constituents of: (1) regulator of complement activation (RCA) genes (rs390679, CFHR1, p≤2.14E-214 | rs12140421, CFHR3, p≤4.63E-29); (2) genes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (rs4151672, CFB, p≤8.91E-41 | rs115404146, HLA-C, p≤6.32E-12 | rs1055821, HLA-B, p≤1.93E-9 | rs1063355, HLA-DQB1, p≤6.82E-14); and (3) genes of the 10q26 AAMD locus (rs1045216, PLEKHA1, p≤4.17E-142 | rs2672603, ARMS2, p≤7.14E-46). We used these findings with existing data on AAMD-related retinal miRNA and transcript profiles for the purpose of making inferences on SNP-mRNA-miRNA-AAMD relationships. Four of 12 miRNAs significantly elevated in AAMD retina (hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p hsa-let-7d-5p) also showed strong pairing capacity (TarBase 7.1 context++ score <-0.2, miRanda 3.3 pairing score >150) with miRNA target transcripts encoded by AAMD-associated SNPs resident in HLA-DQB1 (rs1063355, hsa-miR-155-5p) and TGFBR1 (rs868, hsa-let-7). Three of the 12 miRNAs overexpressed in AAMD retina are inducible by NFkB and have high affinity targets in the complement factor H (CFH) mRNA 3' UTR. We used ENSEMBL to identify polymorphic regions in the CFH mRNA 3' UTR with the capacity to disrupt miRNA-mRNA pairing. Two variants (rs766666504 and rs459598) existed in DNA sequence encoding the seed region of hsa-miR-146a-5p in the CFH mRNA 3' UTR - as this miRNA is also elevated in both vitreous and serum of people with AAMD, it shows great value as a biomarker. Our findings suggest that knowledge on the nature of DNA sequence variation may increase the explanatory power of miRNA biomarkers in genetically diverse populations, while yielding information with which to develop: (1) mechanistic tests on processes implicated in AMD pathogenesis; and, (2) site-specific small molecules (synthetic mimetics or anti-miRNAs) with preventive or therapeutic efficacy for AAMD.
