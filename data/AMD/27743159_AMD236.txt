To evaluate a modified treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen of intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) for treatment-naïve patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Thirty-six eyes (36 patients) treated with the modified TAE regimen were evaluated at 12 months retrospectively. The modified TAE regimen consisted of three steps: 1) an induction phase, during which patients were treated with ≥ 3-monthly IAIs until exudative activity disappeared, 2) an observation phase, during which patients were monitored until exudative activity appeared, and 3) a TAE phase, for which the initial treatment interval was determined based on the disease recurrence interval, followed by treatment intervals changing by 2 weeks.
Mean logMAR BCVA improved significantly from 0.48 ± 0.51 at baseline to 0.40 ± 0.53 at 12 months (P < 0.01), and was maintained (losing <0.3 logMAR units) in 35 eyes (97.2 %). Mean central retinal thickness and central choroidal thickness decreased significantly after 12 months. In the TAE phase, the distribution of treatment intervals was ≥8 weeks in 64.7 % (11 eyes) at 12 months. The mean number of injections was 4.53.
A modified TAE regimen of IAI for neovascular AMD produced good functional outcomes over 12 months with the small number of injections.
