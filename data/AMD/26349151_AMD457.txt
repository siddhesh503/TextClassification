To evaluate results of treatment of choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration with aflibercept in a group of patients representative for Polish population.
Three intravitreal injections of 2.0 mg of aflibercept were administrated to 48 eyes with active choroidal neovascularization at the four week intervals. In the evaluated population there were 19 eyes previously treated with other anti-VEGF drugs and 29 treatment naive eyes.
The mean best corrected visual acuity at baseline in the entire group was 0.47. During the follow-up exam after the first injection, the best corrected visual acuity increased to 0.58. After the second and third injection, it reached the level of 0.62 and 0.63, respectively. Such improvement in visual acuity was accompanied by the reduction of central retinal thickness. Eyes with intraretinal fluid presence confirmed in baseline spectral domain optical coherence tomography had significantly lower best corrected visual acuity throughout the entire follow up.
Three intravitreal aflibercept injections in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration resulted in significant improvement of best corrected visual acuity and reduction of central retinal thickness both in eyes previously treated using other anti-VEGF drugs and newly diagnosed ones. aflibercept, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, anti-VEGF treatment, optical coherence tomography.
