Genetic factors are known to influence the response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The current study was conducted to investigate the association of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphism with the treatment response to ranibizumab for exudative AMD.
One hundred nine eyes (109 patients, 59.6% male, mean age 63.84 ± 7.22 years) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections were included in the analysis. Smoking status and lesion type were recorded. Patients were categorized into three groups according to visual acuity (VA) change at 6 months after the first injection: VA loss >5 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (Group 1); VA change between five ETDRS letters gain and loss (Group 2); VA improvement >5 ETDRS letters (Group 3). The association of ApoE gene polymorphisms with the three groups was evaluated.
Both smoking status and lesion type showed no significant association with VA change (p = 0.12 and p = 0.64, respectively). A lower frequency of ɛ2 and a higher frequency of ɛ4 were observed in Group 3 (2.9 and 25.7%, respectively). VA improvement with more than five ETDRS letters was significantly associated with the presence of the ɛ4 genotype (p = 0.01).
This study demonstrated that carriers of the ApoE ɛ4 polymorphism genotype show demonstrable improvement in VA after treatment with ranibizumab in exudative AMD. ApoE polymorphism identification may be used as a genetic screening to tailor individualized therapeutic approach for optimal treatment in neovascular AMD.
