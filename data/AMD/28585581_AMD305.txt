To determine the association between serum levels of apolipoprotein E, leptin, complimentary factor H and high temperature requirement A-1 in patients with age-related macular degeneration.
This case-control study was conducted at the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May to October 2013, and comprised patients with age-related macular degeneration and matching controls. The confirmation of age-related macular degeneration was carried out through slit lamp examination, fundoscopy and ocular coherence tomography. The selected subjects were not suffering with any other systemic or ophthalmic complication(s). Serum apolipoprotein E, leptin, complimentary factor H and high temperature requirement A-1 were estimated in serum samples of all subjects. SPSS 18 was used for data analysis.
Of the 190 participants, 90(47.4%) were patients with age-related macular degeneration and 100(52.6%) were controls. Significantly elevated serum apolipoprotein E (p<0.0024) and high temperature requirement A-1 (p<0.0001) levels were observed in the patients, while serum leptin (p<0.008) and complimentary factor H (p<0.0001) levels were significantly reduced. Logistic regression showed that lower leptin (p<0.026) and elevated high temperature requirement A-1 (p<0.0001) were the relevant risk factors.
Serum apolipoprotein E, leptin, complimentary factor H and high temperature requirement A-1 levels were altered in age-related macular degeneration patients.
