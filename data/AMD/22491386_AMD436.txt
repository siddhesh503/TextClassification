The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life in persons affected by age-related macular degeneration.
The study was performed in the Clinic of Ophthalmology, Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. A total of 140 patients completed the Visual Functioning Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during this prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with age-related macular degeneration (70 patients) and control patients (70 patients).
There was a significant difference in the quality of life between groups (P<0.0001). Analyzing patients with age-related macular degeneration within the group (patients with monocular or binocular disorders), significant differences in near vision (P=0.003), far vision (P=0.04), color vision (P=0.01), and social functioning (P=0.02) were observed. Mental health (r=0.326, P=0.02), dependency (r=0.340, P=0.02), and role difficulties (r=0.355, P=0.01) were found to be significantly associated with general vision in the age-related macular degeneration group.
Age-related macular degeneration appeared to have a great impact on the quality of life. General vision impairment caused by age-related macular degeneration affects patient's mental health, dependency, and role difficulties.
