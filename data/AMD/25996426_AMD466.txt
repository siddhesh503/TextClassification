Recent studies have suggested that the use of systemic beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers can induce regression of choroidal neovascularization in rodent models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if these agents have a protective effect against the development of choroidal neovascularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration.
In this single-center retrospective case-control study, the charts of 250 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were compared with those of 250 controls with dry age-related macular degeneration. Charts were reviewed for current and past use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Frequency tables were generated, and associations were examined using chi-square tests, t-tests, and multivariate logistic regression.
There was no statistically significant difference between rates of beta-blocker use (P = 0.57), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors use (P = 0.20), or angiotensin receptor blockers use (P = 0.61) between the 2 groups. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between rates of use of combinations of the above drugs between the two groups.
Although there is growing evidence that beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers can induce regression of choroidal neovascularization in rodent models, these medications do not seem to confer a protective effect against the development of choroidal neovascularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration.
