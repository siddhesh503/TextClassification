To assess changes in vision-related quality of life (VR-QoL) among patients with treatment-resistant neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) following intravitreal aflibercept treatment over 48 weeks.
We conducted a prospective study in which 49 patients with nAMD resistant to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy were switched to intravitreal aflibercept. Patients were treated with three loading doses every 4 weeks followed by injections every 8 weeks, for a total of 48 weeks. Ophthalmic examinations performed at each visit included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) measurement. The National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25) was used to assess VR-QoL at baseline and weeks 24 and 48. Changes in NEI VFQ-25 composite and subscale scores were analyzed using paired t tests. The relationship between the change in VR-QoL and changes in BCVA and CMT, and the impact of the better-seeing eye (BSE, defined as the eye reading the greater number of letters at baseline) vs. the worse-seeing eye (WSE, the fellow eye to the BSE) were assessed.
Mean NEI VFQ-25 composite scores improved significantly at weeks 24 and 48 compared to baseline (4.5 ± 9.2 and 4.4 ± 11.8, respectively, all p < 0.01). Among subscales, general vision and near and distance activities showed significant improvements at weeks 24 and 48 (all p < 0.05). Improvement in the NEI VFQ-25 composite score was significantly associated with increased BCVA at week 48 (β coefficient = 0.43, p = 0.029), but not with change in CMT (β coefficient = -0.007, p = 0.631). There was no association between VR-QoL changes and BSE or WSE.
Despite previous anti-VEGF treatment in this cohort, overall VR-QoL improved following aflibercept therapy over 48 weeks. This improvement was related to improved vision in treatment eyes regardless of whether they were the BSE or WSE.
