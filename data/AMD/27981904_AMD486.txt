The preferred approach for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is frequent intravitreal injections of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. However, considering the limitations of current anti-VEGF approaches, including the need for frequent injections, inadequate response in some patients, and a relatively short duration of effect, several new therapeutic modalities are under evaluation.
A comprehensive review of the literature was performed on the new treatment modalities for neovascular AMD, and the relevant studies were discussed.
The treatment modalities for neovascular AMD include new anti-VEGF drugs, new drug delivery systems and new targets in the pathogenic cascade of choroidal neovascularization. These new modalities are in different phases of clinical development.
The results of the completed studies reporting the new therapeutic modalities for neovascular AMD thus far are promising.
