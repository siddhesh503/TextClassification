To analyze adherence to follow-up over 5 years in patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a tertiary health care center. To investigate factors associated with failure to continue follow-up.
Retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients with exudative AMD, who received their first intravitreal ranibizumab injection at the Cr√©teil Intercommunal University Hospital Eye Clinic between October 1, 2006 and March 31, 2007. Patient clinical characteristics at baseline and at the last follow-up visit were recorded. Distance from home to hospital was measured for each patient. A multiple-choice telephone survey was conducted for patients lost to follow-up to determine the main reasons for failure to continue follow-up.
Two hundred and one patients were included. The rate of loss to follow-up over the 5-year period was 57% (115/201). Fifty-eight patients lost to follow-up completed the questionnaire. The main reasons reported by patients for follow-up discontinuation were long distance from home to hospital (51.7%, 30/58), subjective dissatisfaction with the benefits of intravitreal injections (34.5%, 20/58), and the excessive burden of periodic follow-up visits (24.1%, 14/58). Three factors were significantly associated with follow-up discontinuation: high age at baseline (82.2 vs. 76.5 years, P<0.001), poor best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline (42.5 vs. 51.0 letters, P=0.020), and long distance from home to hospital (132 vs. 17.1km, P<0.001).
In this study, adherence to follow-up over 5 years was poor. Age and BCVA at baseline and distance from home to hospital were independently associated with long-term adherence.
