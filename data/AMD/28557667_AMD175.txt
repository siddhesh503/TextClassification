Comparative data appertaining to the long-term effects of Aflibercept or Ranibizumab in newly diagnosed cases of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) over follow-up periods exceeding 12 months in clinical routine are scarce.
In this retrospective comparative analysis, a case series of patients with treatment-naïve nAMD and requiring anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in a routine clinical setting were treated with either Aflibercept [Afl (n = 106)] or Ranibizumab [Ran (n = 47)]. During the drug-loading phase, 3 monthly injections were administered. Thereafter, a treat-and-extend protocol was pursued for a maximum of 24 months. Ran was administered predominantly in eyes with classical lesions; Afl was administered in all others. The primary outcome parameters included anatomical and functional stability after 24 months.
Patients were comparable regarding age, gender distribution, and lens status. Fewer patients presented with intraretinal fluid in the Afl- than in the Ran group at diagnosis (46.2% vs. 67.4%; P = 0.02), but not after the drug-loading phase. After the drug-loading phase, visual acuity [-4.2 letters (Afl) vs. -4.5 letters (Ran); P = 0.78] and the central foveal thickness remained stable. Linked to the lesion type, the number of scheduled clinical visits during the course of 24 months was higher for the Ran- than for the Afl group [11.9 ± 4.7 visits (Ran) vs. 8.4 ± 3.1 visits (Afl); P = 0.0005]. However, the total number of injections was similar [10.5 ± 2.8 (Ran) vs. 11.7 ± 3.6 (Afl); P = 0.06].
Based on tailoring according to the lesion type in cases of nAMD, the anatomical and the functional outcomes of treatment with either Afl or Ran were comparable for a maximum of 2 years.
