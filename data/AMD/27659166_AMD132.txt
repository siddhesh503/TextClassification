Damage of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells by A2E may be critical for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) management. Accumulation and photooxidation of A2E are known to be one of the critical causes in AMD. Here, we evaluated the protective effect of resveratrol (RES), piceatannol (PIC) and RES glycones on blue-light-induced RPE cell death caused by A2E photooxidation. A2E treatment followed by blue light exposure caused significant damages on human RPE cells (ARPE-19). But the damages were attenuated by post- and pre-treatment of RES and PIC in our in vitro models. The results of cell free system and FAB-MS analysis clearly showed that the reduction of A2E by blue light exposure was significantly rescued, and that oxidized forms of A2E were significantly reduced by RES or PIC treatment. Besides, RES or PIC inhibited the intracellular accumulation of A2E. Not only RES and PIC but RES glycones showed protection of ARPE-19 cells against A2E and blue-light-induced photo-damage. These findings demonstrate that RES and its analogs may have protective effects against A2E and blue-light-induced ARPE-19 cell death through regulation of A2E accumulation as well as photooxidation of A2E. Thus RES and its analogs may be beneficial for AMD treatment.
