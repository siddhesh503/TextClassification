To assess choroidal thickness (CT) and its relationship to retinal sensitivity in mild/moderate age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Seventy-two eyes of 51 participants with mild/moderate AMD and 36 eyes of 18 age-matched normal participants were prospectively recruited to undergo enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) imaging and microperimetry (MP) functional assessment. OCT-measured CT and retinal thickness (RT) were matched with MP sensitivity at 13 retinal loci, and correlations were analysed.
Patients with AMD had an average RT 56.5 Î¼m greater than those without AMD (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in CT between normal and AMD participants (p = 0.36). In patients without atrophy or pigment epithelial detachment, there was no correlation between MP sensitivity and CT (p = 0.08); however, a correlation between RT and MP was detected (b = 0.006, p = 0.046). Among patients without AMD, MP sensitivity was positively correlated with RT (b = 0.007, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with CT (b = 0.0046, p = 0.035).
CT does not correlate with retinal sensitivity in AMD. Although choroidal damage and impaired choroidal perfusion appear to be important concepts in AMD pathogenesis, increasing choroidal thinning may not be associated with worsening retinal function in AMD.
