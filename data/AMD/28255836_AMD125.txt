To evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on disease activation and visual outcomes in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
In this retrospective case-control study, study arm consisted of neovascular AMD patients, who underwent phacoemulsification surgery. Patients did not have any disease activation at least 6 months before the inclusion, and all had at least 12-month follow-up thereafter. Control group consisted of phakic patients, who did not undergo eye surgery during the study period. Primary outcomes were the presence of the disease activation and the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
A total of 114 neovascular AMD patients [55 (48%) in exudative group and 59 (52%) in disciform group] were included. Preoperative logMAR BCVA was significantly improved after cataract surgery [0.8 (0.6-1.0) vs. 0.4 (0.4-0.7), P < 0.001 in exudative AMD; 1.85 (1.1-1.9) vs. 1.09 (0.8-1.9), P = 0.001 in disciform scar], but this improvement was not maintained during the study period in patients with both exudative AMD and disciform scar [0.6 (0.3-1.1), P = 0.313 in exudative AMD; 1.30 (1-1.9), P = 0.03 in disciform scar]. The incidence of disease activation was not statistically significant between surgery and control groups in patients with exudative AMD [5 (25%) patients in surgery group and 8 (22%) patients in the control group, P = 0.886, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis]. In disciform scar, disease activation was observed in 4 (17%) patients in the surgery group; however, no patient in the control group had disease activation (P = 0.009, HRs could not be estimated, 95% CI 0.001-43.49, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis).
Cataract surgery has benefit on early postoperative visual improvement in patients with neovascular AMD. The incidence of disease activation was not affected after surgery in exudative AMD.
