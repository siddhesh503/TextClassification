To determine safety and visual outcomes in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) implanted with a novel intraocular lens (IOL) that delivers an optimized retinal image to all macular areas within 10 degrees of retinal eccentricity.
This was a consecutive case series of 244 eyes with dry/stable wet AMD and logMAR visual acuity ≥0.3 implanted with iolAMD Eyemax mono<sup>TM</sup> (London Eye Hospital Pharma), a single-piece, injectable, hydrophobic acrylic IOL sited in the capsular bag. Primary outcome was safety. Secondary outcomes were changes in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and corrected near visual acuity (CNVA) (logMAR).
Mean age at surgery was 80 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 3 months (range 1-16 months). No eyes had worsening of CDVA. Frequency of perioperative complications was equivalent to standard IOL implantation. Postoperative refractive outcomes were within ±1 D of the target refraction in 88% of cases. Mean preoperative CDVA improved from 1.06 to 0.71 postoperatively (mean of differences -0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.3886 to -0.3223; p<0.0001), equating to an approximate Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study gain of 18 letters. Mean preoperative CNVA (N-point; logMAR conversion) improved from 1.36 to 0.88 postoperatively (mean of differences -0.48; 95% CI -0.53 to -0.44; p<0.0001).
This novel IOL appears safe in the short to medium term. Improvements in postoperative CDVA and CNVA exceed those observed with standard implants.
