The approval of aflibercept for the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration has opened up the possibility of treating patients with fewer injections, since the drug can be administered once every two months. Aflibercept can also be used as rescue therapy in patients with suboptimal response to other antiangiogenic treatments. The present study reviews the scientific evidence on aflibercept, both in treatment-na√Øve patients and in those with an unsatisfactory response to conventional treatments.
