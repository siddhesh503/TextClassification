To assess whether best-corrected visual acuity and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) height, volume, and reflectivity in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration are influenced by baseline anatomical and functional parameters, including quantifiable metrics of PED morphology and choice of treatment.
One hundred two consecutive, treatment-naive wet age-related macular degeneration patients with PED (>50 Î¼m) treated with aflibercept (52) or ranibizumab (50) were retrospectively included. Pigment epithelial detachment height, horizontal and vertical dimensions, and volume were recorded at baseline, 3 months, and 1 year, respectively. Bespoke image analysis software provided a quantifiable measure of reflectivity.
Best-corrected visual acuity at 3 months was influenced by baseline best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.006). Pigment epithelial detachment height was influenced by baseline height (P = 0.009), subretinal fluid (P = 0.008), central macular thickness (P = 0.006), and use of aflibercept (P = 0.003) at 3 months and by baseline height (P = 0.018), volume (P = 0.017), vertical dimension (P = 0.0004), and aflibercept (P = 0.015) at 1 year. Pigment epithelial detachment reflectivity increased from 43.59 to 55.86 (3 months) and 57.35 (1 year) (P < 0.001) and was influenced by its baseline values and, interestingly, use of aflibercept at 3 months (P = 0.013).
Quantifiable metrics of PED morphology improve with treatment, and PED content becomes hyperreflective, more so on aflibercept. Pigment epithelial detachments respond better in the context of more active disease. More hyporeflective PED content may predispose to better treatment response, especially with aflibercept.
