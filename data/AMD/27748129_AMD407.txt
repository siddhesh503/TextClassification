Vascular endothelial growth factor antibody therapy is an established treatment of exsudative age-related macular degeneration.
The morphologic characterisation of the macular microvasculature after longstanding treatment.
Forty-eight patients (34 women and 14 men; age, 74.4 ± 8.0 years) were enrolled in the study. During follow-up time (53.8 ± 31.0 months), 7.6 ± 4.9 injections were administered in 56 eyes. Optical coherence tomography angiographic examination was performed with AngioVue (Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA, USA).
Distortion of the superficial retinal plexus and foveal avascular zone enlargement were noted in 5/56 eyes, deep retinal plexus defect was detected in 9/56 cases. Destruction of the choriocapillaries and the former neovascularisation could be found in 4 different patterns: 1. pigment epithelium and choriocapillary atrophy, 2. submacular scar, 3. active leaking choroidal neovascularisation, 4. intraretinal cysts.
Optical coherence tomography angiography is a novel non-invasive method, which enables the follow up of macular degeneration. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(42), 1683-1690.
