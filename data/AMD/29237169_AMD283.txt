To evaluate outer retina and choroidal thickness in subjects with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) and to describe associations with the presence of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD).
This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 157 consecutive eyes (specifically: 62 eyes classified as having RPD and 95 eyes with drusen ≥125 µm). Only cases with digital color fundus photographs, red-free, and infrared, obtained and graded according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study to define iAMD, were used for this study. Outer retina and choroidal thickness were manually segmented and quantified at 12 locations in the horizontal meridian.
RPD appeared to be associated with thinning of the outer layers even after adjustment for gender and age. The presence of RPD in iAMD decreased with increase of choroidal thickness (total odds ratio [OR] 0.991, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.985-0.996; nasal OR 0.992, 95% CI 0.986-0.997), with increased thickness of the myoid zone of the photoreceptors (total OR 0.812, 95% CI 0.688-0.958; nasal OR 0.863, 95% CI 0.755-0.987) and with increased thickness of the outer segment of the photoreceptors (total OR 0.850, 95% CI 0.731-0.989; nasal OR 0.857, 95% CI 0.736-0.989).
The greatest differences between eyes with and without RPD are found at the level of the choroidal thickness and at the level of the photoreceptors.
