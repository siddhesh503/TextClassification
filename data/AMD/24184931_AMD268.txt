The results of intravitreal ranibizumab treatment for exsudative age-related macular degeneration have been favourable until this time.
To evaluate the two-year functional and anatomic results of intravitreal ranibizumab treatment.
46 patients (age: 75 Â± 9.1 years) were included in a prospective single center study. Treatment regimen was the following: monthly 0.5 mg ranibizumab was administered in the first 3 months, and later as required (pro re nata). The change of best corrected visual acuity and central retinal thickness was followed.
The visus change at the end of the follow-up time was not statistically significant compared to baseline (p = 0.760) and the at the end of the first year (p = 0.154). Central retinal thickness decreased significantly compared to baseline (p = 0.000001), but the change was not statistically significant compared to the end of the first year (p = 0.875).
Patients with neovascular macular degeneration treated with intravitreal ranibizumab using pro re nata regimen have stable visus for long term, and the exsudation could be reduced efficiently.
