Various in vitro culture systems have been used to investigate the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, many still rely on oversimplified monolayer culture models. AMD is a complex disease, associated with the pathological changes to multiple structural components such as the Bruch's membrane, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroidal endothelial cells. This study aims to construct a novel 3D coculture model using the polycaprolactone (PCL)-gelatin electrospun scaffold, with human RPE cells (hRPE) and primate choroidal cells (RF-6A). Results from this study show that PCL-gelatin scaffolds have a highly porous ultrastructure that supports the attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of the hRPEs and choroidal endothelial cells. It is also demonstrated that the PCL-gelatin 3D coculture model may be useful in exploring the molecular interplay between the hPRE and the choroidal endothelial cells, and their effects on growth factor modulation, which may be important in the pathogenesis of AMD.
