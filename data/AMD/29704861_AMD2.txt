The present anti-angiogenic therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration require effective drug delivery systems for transfer drug molecules. Ranibizumab is an active humanized monoclonal antibody that counteracts active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor A in the neovascular age-related macular degeneration therapy. The development of ranibizumab-related therapies, we have designed the effective drug career with engineered magnetic nanoparticles (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) as a facile platform of ranibizumab delivery for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Ranibizumab conjugated iron oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)/PEGylated poly lactide-co-glycolide (PEG-PLGA) was successfully designed and the synthesized materials are analyzed different analytical techniques. The microscopic techniques (Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) & Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)) are clearly displayed that spherical nanoparticles into the PEG-PLGA matrix and presence of elements and chemical interactions confirmed by the results of energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and Fourier trans-form infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods. The in vitro anti-angiogenic evaluation of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/PEG-PLGA polymer nanomaterial efficiently inhibits the tube formation in the Matrigel-based assay method by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Ranibizumab treated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/PEG-PLGA polymer nanomaterials not disturbed cell proliferation and the results could not display the any significant differences in human endothelial cells. The present investigated results describe that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/PEG-PLGA polymer nanomaterials can be highly favorable and novel formulation for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
