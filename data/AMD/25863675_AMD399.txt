To investigate the association of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) with aqueous levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
This is a prospective comparative study. Subjects are 33 eyes with exudative AMD. PVD was examined by B-mode ultrasonography and the subjects were divided into a complete PVD group (PVD group) or a group with partial or no PVD (without PVD group). At the beginning of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab, aqueous humor was collected and the concentration of VEGF was measured using ELISA. The concentration was compared between the two groups.
Complete PVD was observed in 13 (39 %) eyes. The mean concentration of VEGF was 58 pg/ml in the PVD group and 91 pg/ml in the without PVD group. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the concentration of VEGF was significantly lower in the eyes with PVD than in those without PVD independent of age and sex (P = 0.02).
Complete PVD is related to the lower concentration of aqueous VEDF in AMD eyes.
