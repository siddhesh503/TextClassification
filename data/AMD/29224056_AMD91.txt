In this study (AMD2000), we aimed to determine the visual prognosis of Japanese patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
This was a multicenter prospective observational cohort study. In total, 460 patients with AMD were recruited from April 2006 to March 2009 from 18 clinical trial sites in Japan. They were followed up for 5 years, as they continued to receive medical treatment.
Of the 409 study eyes followed up for at least 1 year, 243 eyes (59.4%) were treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using verteporfin, and 58 eyes (14.2%) were treated with intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents as the initial treatment. The mean best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) for typical AMD (tAMD; 0.688 ± 0.498) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV; 0.451 ± 0.395) were significantly less at 2 years (tAMD, 0.779 ± 0.632, P < 0.05; PCV, 0.534 ± 0.618, P < 0.05) and at 5 years (AMD, 0.873 ± 0.718, P < 0.05; PCV, 0.635 ± 0.668, P < 0.05) than at baseline. In eyes with tAMD, absence of blocked fluorescence was associated with 5-year maintenance of the baseline BCVA. Regarding PCV, the presence of polypoidal lesions and cystoid macular edema as well as the lesion size was associated with 5-year maintenance of the baseline BCVA. In some patients, the diagnosis changed: of the 192 eyes initially diagnosed with typical AMD, 19 were newly diagnosed with PCV during follow-up.
Maintaining the baseline BCVA over the long term is difficult in Japanese eyes with wet AMD.
