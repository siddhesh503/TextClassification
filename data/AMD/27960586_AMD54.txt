To evaluate long-term changes in visual acuity and retinal microstructure in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who had maintained dry macula after initial treatment.
This retrospective observational study included 55 eyes that were diagnosed with neovascular AMD, were treated with three monthly ranibizumab injections, and maintained dry macula during a two-year follow-up. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at three months and at the final follow-up were compared, and the degree of visual improvement was compared between eyes with and without improvement of the ellipsoid zone. In addition, the incidence of improvement of the ellipsoid zone was compared between eyes with different extents of disruption.
The mean follow-up period was 30.3 ± 4.1 months. BCVA at three months and at the final follow-up was 0.51 ± 0.46 and 0.45 ± 0.49 (P<0.001). Among 35 eyes that exhibited >200 μm of disruption of the ellipsoid zone, 15 (42.9%) showed improvement of the ellipsoid zone, and the improvement in BCVA was greater in these eyes than that in the remaining 20 eyes (P=0.021). A higher incidence of improvement of the ellipsoid zone was noted in eyes with 200 to 800 μm of disruption than in eyes with >800 μm of disruption (P<0.001).
Long-term improvement in visual acuity was noted in eyes that had maintained dry macula after three ranibizumab injections. The status of the ellipsoid zone at three months was closely associated with visual improvement.
