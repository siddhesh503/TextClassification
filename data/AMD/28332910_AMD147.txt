To examine the association between xanthophyll intake and prevalent early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (n = 10,295). Potential effect modification by genetic polymorphisms and biomarkers of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism was explored.
Xanthophyll intake was assessed at visit 1 (1987-1989) using food frequency questionnaires. Prevalent early AMD was assessed at visit 3 (1993-1995) via retinal photographs. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for AMD by quintiles of xanthophyll intake, adjusted for age, sex, race, field center, and pack-years of smoking. To evaluate effect modification, the association between tertiles (T) of xanthophyll intake and AMD was stratified by complement factor H (CFH) rs1061170 and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) rs10490924 genotypes, as well as by median cutpoints of HDL biomarkers.
Xanthophyll intake was not associated with AMD in the overall sample, Caucasians (n = 8257), or African-Americans (n = 2038). Exploratory analyses observed that the association between xanthophyll intake and AMD varied statistically significantly by CFH rs1061170 genotype among Caucasians (p for interaction = 0.045) but not African Americans. No interactions were observed between xanthophyll intake and ARMS2 rs10490924. Moreover, higher xanthophyll intake was associated with decreased odds of AMD among participants with lower HDL (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.09) but not higher HDL (p for interaction = 0.048).
Xanthophyll intake was not associated with early AMD. Further studies to investigate this association by genetic susceptibility or variations in HDL metabolism are needed.
