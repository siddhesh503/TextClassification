To study the effects of converting to aflibercept in accordance with a treat and extend (T&E) strategy in eyes with treatment resistant exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Two-year prospective study of eyes with exudative AMD and persistent macular fluid despite monthly treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Eyes were converted to 2.0 mg aflibercept in accordance with a T&E protocol.
Fifty eyes from 47 patients were included. At baseline, the mean central retinal thickness (CRT) was 273 μm and mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 0.25 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR). The mean number of aflibercept injections the first year was 9.2. After 1 year, there was a reduction in mean CRT to 228 μm (p < 0.001); 22 eyes (44%) had a dry macula; and the mean BCVA was 0.24 logMAR (p = 0.531). The mean number of aflibercept injections the second year was 8.0 (p = 0.013 compared to first year). After 2 years, 24 eyes (48%) received treatment more frequently than every eighth week. The mean CRT was 225 μm (p < 0.001 compared to baseline); 31 eyes (62%) had a dry macula; and mean BCVA was 0.32 logMAR (p = 0.005 compared to baseline). Five eyes did not complete 2 years of aflibercept treatment after failing to improve.
A majority of eyes showed improved anatomic outcomes. There was a small decrease in mean BCVA after the second year of treatment. About half of the eyes required treatment more frequently than the recommended aflibercept label of an 8-week interval.
