To explore whether the complement factor H (CFH) polymorphism rs1061170/Y402H is associated with responsiveness to antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We reviewed the English literature to examine the association between the polymorphism rs1061170/Y402H of the CFH gene and responsiveness to treatment with anti-VEGF drugs in AMD patients. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was also performed. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Stata V.12.0. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using Q-statistic testing. Fourteen relevant studies including a total of 2963 AMD patients were eligible. In AMD patients without a treatment history, individuals carrying the rs1061170/Y402H TT genotype were more likely to achieve a better outcome (OR = 1.932, 95% CI = 1.125-3.317, p = 0.017) than those carrying the CC genotype. The polymorphism rs1061170/Y402H might be a genetic predictor of treatment response to anti-VEGF therapy in AMD patients. Further prospective research including a larger number of patients is needed to validate this finding.
