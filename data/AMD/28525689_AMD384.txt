Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by lesions in the central area of the retina. The pathogenesis of AMD involves aging-associated changes in the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and in Bruch's membrane, but the mechanisms that trigger the conversion of normal age-related changes into the pathological process are not known. The result of pathological changes in the RPE and choroid is the death of photoreceptors and irreversible loss of vision. In spite of numerous studies on AMD pathogenesis, the information about the molecular genetic preconditions of events leading to the death of photoreceptors - as well as about the pathways of death - is extremely limited. This situation makes it difficult to identify effective treatments of AMD, in particular, the most common, i.e., atrophic («dry») form of the disease. Recent studies showed that not only proapoptotic but also necrosis-associated, and autophagy-related signaling pathways are involved in the death of retinal cells. This review summarizes the data available in the literature on the three basic types of cell death: apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy and their role in the pathogenesis of AMD.
