The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and association of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and obesity which was not studied extensively in Indian population over 60 years of age.
This was a cross-sectional, population-based study. A total of 4791 patients with gradable fundus photography were included. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and AMD was graded with retinal photographs. Grading of AMD was done according to the International ARM Epidemiological Study Group and staged based on grading in worse eye. The association of AMD severity and obesity (based on body mass index, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, isolated abdominal obesity, isolated generalized obesity, and combined obesity) was assessed. The main outcome variable was an association between the presence and severity of AMD with different grades of obesity.
No direct significant association was noted between the presence and severity of AMD and any obesity indices. Subgroup analyses based on lifestyle patterns and common systemic pathologies in AMD population were done. Late AMD was significantly associated with tobacco consumption in population with combined obesity (P = 0.033 and odds ratio = 2.998).
No direct association was noted between the presence or severity of AMD and obesity in South Indian population. However, indirect associations between the severity of AMD and combined obesity were found.
