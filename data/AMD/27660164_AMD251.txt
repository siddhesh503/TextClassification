To clarify the efficacy of aflibercept for treating exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
We prospectively studied 47 eyes with AMD. Forty-seven patients (mean age 72.2 years) received three consecutive monthly intravitreal aflibercept injections followed by an injection every 2 months until 12 months. The primary outcome was the 12-month visual results compared with baseline; the secondary outcomes were the prevalence of geography atrophy (GA), a dry macula at month 12, and anatomic changes on optical coherence tomography.
The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in 27 eyes with typical AMD and 20 eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) significantly (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, respectively) improved from 0.60 to 0.32 at baseline to 0.29 and 0.21 at month 12. At month 12, 22 (81.5 %) eyes with typical AMD and 17 (85 %) eyes with PCV had dry macula. The subfoveal choroidal thicknesses in typical AMD and PCV decreased significantly (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons) from 241 ± 118 and 294 ± 76 μ at baseline to 198 ± 104 and 244 ± 84 μ at month 12. Progressing or new GA was seen in three eyes with typical AMD and one eye with PCV; the mean change in the BCVA was significantly (p = 0.0026) worse at month 12. No other complications developed.
Intravitreal aflibercept significantly improved VA and anatomic changes in typical AMD and PCV over 12 months. Development of GA might be a risk for declining VA.
