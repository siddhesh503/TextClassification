To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept administered to patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration.
70 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration confirmed clinically and in additional diagnostic procedures (fluorescein angiography and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography) were enrolled. All patients were administered three doses of intravitreal aflibercept at one-month intervals. Some patients (seven) received an additional injection of the drug two months after the last of the three injections. The best-corrected visual acuity and the optical coherence tomography findings were assessed at baseline and after the treatment.
At baseline, the mean best corrected visual acuity was 0.20. After the injection of aflibercept it improved to the mean value of 0.32 with the difference being statistically significant (p < 0.001, Student's t-test). The mean central subfield thickness at baseline was 311.4 μm. It decreased to mean value of 254.5 pμn with the difference being statistically significant (p<0.001, Student's t-test).
Intravitreal injections of aflibercept improved clinical and anatomical parameters in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration in the initial phase of treatment.
