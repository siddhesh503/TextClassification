To assess the time from symptom onset to treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) and to measure the awareness of AMD in Southeast Scotland.
Retrospective cross-sectional study.
Secondary care, Southeast of Scotland.
Patients treated with intravitreal therapy (IVT) for nvAMD in Southeast Scotland between 2013 and 2015 were identified using a treatment register. Notes were retrospectively reviewed. We measured time from: (A) symptom onset to first presentation at primary care, (B) referral to ophthalmic clinic appointment and (C) ophthalmic clinic appointment to first IVT treatment. To investigate AMD awareness, we performed a cluster random sample survey of patients visiting non-AMD ophthalmic clinics using a previously validated 12-item questionnaire.
195 patients (mean age 78 years) were included in the study. The mean delays between the different stages-A, B and C-were 54.2 (95% CI ±13), 28.2 (95% CI ±4.0) and 31.5 (95% CI ±3.6) days, respectively. There was an additional mean delay of 7.5 (95% CI ±1.6) days when patients were indirectly referred by optometrists via general practitioners (P<0.05). 140 patients (mean age 78) participated in the awareness survey; 62.1% reported being 'aware' of AMD but only 37.3% described AMD symptoms correctly.
There was a significant delay at every step of the nvAMD care pathway. The causes for this were multifactorial and included delays in first presentation to a healthcare provider, referral from primary care and initiation of secondary care treatment. Our data are likely to underestimate prehospital delays as a large number of cases are likely to have undefined symptoms and onset. We also identified suboptimal awareness of AMD which could account for a substantial delay in presentation from symptom onset. These findings highlight the need to address AMD awareness and the need for urgent treatment to prevent avoidable vision loss resulting from nvAMD.
