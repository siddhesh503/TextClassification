Optical coherence tomography angiography is a new imaging modality that provides noninvasive characterization and quantification of the microvasculature in different retinal conditions. The purpose of this study was to give an updated review of the features of dry age-related macular degeneration investigated by means of new-generation optical coherence tomography angiography. We searched PubMed and Medline using the terms "optical coherence tomography angiography" associated with "age-related macular degeneration," "drusen," "reticular pseudodrusen," and "geographic atrophy" and reviewed publications up to JanuaryÂ 2017.
