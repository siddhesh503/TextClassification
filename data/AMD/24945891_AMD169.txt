To examine the association between retinal vascular caliber and early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in an Indian population.
A total of 3112 Indian participants aged ≥40 years from the population-based Singapore Indian Eye Study who had data available on retinal vascular caliber measurements and AMD status were included. Retinal arteriolar and venular calibers were measured from digital photographs using computer-assisted software according to a standardized protocol. Images of the macular region were graded according to the modified Wisconsin age-related maculopathy grading system. Right eyes were selected for analyses. Binary logistic regression models were used to assess the association, adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, random blood glucose, body mass index, and the companion retinal vascular caliber.
A total of 107 participants (3.4%) were diagnosed with early AMD. Neither arteriolar nor venular caliber was related to AMD. For early AMD, the age-, sex-, and companion retinal vascular caliber-adjusted odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) decrease in arteriolar caliber was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84-1.31; p = 0.671), and per SD increase in venular caliber was OR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.77-1.20); p = 0.714. No trend was found after categorizing retinal vascular calibers into quartiles. Multivariate adjustment and stratified analyses did not alter these results.
Retinal vascular calibers were not related to early AMD among Indian participants. These findings differ from those of several previous studies performed in Caucasian and Asian populations.
