Age-related macular degeneration(AMD) is one of the main leading causes of irreversible vision damage in patients over 50 years old. Genetic factors play an important role in the occurrence and development of AMD. Since the significant correlation between complement factor H (CFH) gene and AMD was found, the pharmacogenomics of CFH polymorphism was paid close attention by academic circles. Among which, studies concerning CFH Y402H were more deeply. Studies have found CFH Y402H genotypes might lead to differences toward the outcome of PDT and anti-VEGF treatment. In this article, we review the researches on the pharmacogenomics of CFH Y402H in wet AMD treatment. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2017, 53: 144-147)</i>.
