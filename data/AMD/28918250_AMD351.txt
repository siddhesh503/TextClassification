To determine the frequency of the genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and their associations with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the Lithuanian population.
A total of 1264 subjects were examined: 251 patients with early AMD, 206 patients with exudative AMD, and 807 healthy controls.
The genotyping of CETP (rs5882, rs708272, rs3764261, rs1800775, rs2303790) was carried out using the RT-PCR.
Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that each copy of rs5882 allele A was associated with a 1.3-fold increased risk of exudative AMD (p=0.046). The G/A and A/A genotypes of the rs708272 polymorphism were associated with 1.5-fold and 1.7-fold increased risks of exudative AMD (p=0.049 and p=0.021, respectively). Combination of two genotypes (G/A+A/A) under the dominant model were associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of exudative AMD (p=0.021). Analysis of rs708272 revealed that the G/A and A/A genotypes under the co-dominant model were associated with 1.5-fold and 1.7-fold increased risks of exudative AMD, respectively (OR=1.450, 95% CI=1.002-2.098; p=0.049 and OR=1.710, 95% CI=1.064-2.156; p=0.021, respectively). Both genotypes (G/A+A/A) under the dominant model were associated with the 1.5-fold increased risk of exudative AMD, as well (OR=1.514, 95% CI=1.064-2.156; p=0.021) and each additional copy A allele was associated with a 1.3-fold increased risk of exudative AMD (OR=1.316, 95% CI=1.051-1.646; p=0.016). The rs3764261 polymorphism was identified to be protective: the C/A genotype and the combination of two genotypes (C/A+A/A) were associated with 1.8-fold and 1.5-fold decreased risks of exudative AMD (p=0.001 and p=0.015, respectively).
Our study identified two polymorphisms with a higher risk of AMD development (rs5882 and rs708272) and a protective polymorphism for AMD (rs3764261).
