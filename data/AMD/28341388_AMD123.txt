Anti-VEGF therapies have revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The goal of this study was to evaluate the "real life" visual and anatomical outcomes of aflibercept treatment for treatment-naive patients with exudative AMD.
This was a retrospective study of patients treated with aflibercept in the department of Ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bordeaux between November 2013 and July 2015. The follow-up period varied from 3months to 2years. All patients received an induction phase with 3monthly intravitreal injections (IVT) followed by personalized monitoring. ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus examination and OCT were performed at each visit. Data were collected at day 0, 3 months, 6, 9, 12months, 18 and 24months.
Forty-three eyes of forty patients, mean age 77.7years, were included, with a minimum of 3months follow-up. Twenty-five eyes were followed for 1year; 5 eyes for two years. At baseline, the mean BCVA was 55.7 letters. Patients received 7.5 injections on average the first year and 2.6 the 2nd year. The mean gain of visual acuity was +7.3 letters at 3 months, +6.2 letters at 12 months, and +6.8 letters at 2years. Anatomically, the OCT data showed a decline of all parameters. The central macular thickness decreased by 118.3μm at 3months, 136.4μm at 12months and 65.5μm at 2years.
Aflibercept can achieve effective visual and anatomical outcomes with results, which approach the pivotal studies, despite the use of personalized protocols and longer monitoring intervals.
