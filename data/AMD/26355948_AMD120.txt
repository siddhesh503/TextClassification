To describe bridge arch-shaped serous retinal detachment (SRD) in exudative age-related macular degeneration and evaluate its functional outcomes.
In this monocentric, retrospective, noncomparative case series, patients were included. Patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration and bridge arch-shaped SRD treated with ranibizumab were included. Anatomical patterns of SRD and functional outcomes were assessed.
Twenty-two eyes with bridge arch-shaped SRD of 22 patients with age-related macular degeneration were included. Serous retinal detachments were characterized by a steep angle at the junction between the retinal pigment epithelium and the sensory retina (mean, 53.45 ± 12.5°), and characterized by the presence of adhesion areas between the sensory retina and a fibrous complex developed from the choroidal neovascularization. In 15 eyes, the choroidal neovascularization was classic choroidal neovascularization and a fibrotic evolution was observed. Serous retinal detachments were compartmentalized in 14 eyes, leading to a multipocket structure. Visual acuity decreased from 49.9 ± 19.2 letters (20/100) to 40.3 ± 18.6 letters (20/160), corresponding to a mean change of -9.6 ± 19.4 letters.
This was the first study to describe the specific morphologic features of bridge arch-shaped SRD, a previously undescribed type of SRD complicating exudative age-related macular degeneration. Patients with bridge arch-shaped SRD responded to intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, but their visual prognosis was unfavorable, compared with the literature. The presence of bridge arch-shaped SRD seemed to be a marker for the fibrotic evolution of the choroidal neovascularization.
