Evaluation of the impact of different macular optical coherence parameters on visual acuity as early as 1 day after injection of ranibizumab in patients with subfoveal exsudative age-related macular degeneration.
This was an interventional, non randomized, open label prospective study, where we evaluated 20 eyes of 20 patients affected by exudative age-related macular degeneration. These patients were treated with injections of ranibizumab between February 2013 and January 2015. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the early changes in optical coherence tomography parameters (retinal thickness, central and total retinal volume) and impact on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) obtained by logarithm of minimum resolution using ETDRS protocol in patients treated with a single dose intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 mL) during the first month of follow. The patients were evaluated on the first day, them at 7 and 30 days after the treatment. The National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire was applied during the study period to assess early perception of ranibizumab injection effectiveness. The adverse events were monitored throughout the study.
Central retinal thickness values at 1 (464.0 ± 97.8 µm), 7 (379.9 ± 107.8 µm) and 30 days (365.5 ± 95.1 µm) after ranibizumab injection showed a statically significant reduction when compared with baseline results (<i>P</i> = 0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.001, respectively). Similar alterations were observed in central and total retinal volume, which were detected early on the first day of evaluation, after the measurement at baseline (central: 0.36 ± 0.07 vs. 0.40 ± 0.10 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>P</i> = 0.01; total: 9.62 ± 1.10 vs. 9.99 ± 2.56 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and remained steady at 7 (<i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.002, respectively) and 30 days (<i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.004, respectively) with slight variations without losing their gains in these parameters. The best-corrected logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) showed a statistically significant difference when compared to the baseline. (0.81 ± 0.16 vs. 0.67 ± 0.24, <i>P</i> = 0.005). The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire demonstrate statically significant results after treatment. When patients were asked about the subjective improvement in visual quality, over 80% reported early improvement. Throughout the period of follow-up visits, no serious adverse events were reported.
Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab can produce early changes in optical coherence tomography parameters and an improvement in perceived visual quality of patients with subfoveal exsudative age-related macular degeneration.
