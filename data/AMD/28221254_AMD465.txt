To determine the presenting characteristics of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration with long-term remission (LTR), which was defined as the absence of intraretinal/subretinal fluid, or hemorrhage, and absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography for longer than 6 months while on as-needed antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment.
The presenting characteristics of patients with LTR were compared with a control group including 32 eyes of 28 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched patients who did not achieve LTR.
Seventy-four percent of patients in the LTR group had Type 1 choroidal neovascular membrane and 18.5% had retinal angiomatous proliferation. In the control group, 28 eyes had Type 1 choroidal neovascular membrane (87.5%), and none of the patients had retinal angiomatous proliferation; overall, there was a significant difference in lesion types between the 2 groups (P = 0.036). Eyes with LTR at presentation had significantly thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness (147 vs. 178 Î¼m, P = 0.04). There was more intraretinal fluid and less subretinal fluid at the presentation in the remission group (59.3% intraretinal fluid and 11.1% subretinal fluid) compared with the control group (28.1% intraretinal fluid and 34.4% subretinal fluid, P = 0.03).
The presence of retinal angiomatous proliferation, thinner choroidal thickness, more intraretinal fluid, and less subretinal fluid at presentation were associated with LTR in patients receiving as-needed treatment for age-related macular degeneration.
