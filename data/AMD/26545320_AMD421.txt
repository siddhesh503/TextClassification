To evaluate the association between use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs and retinal or subretinal hemorrhage in participants with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT).
Cohort study within CATT.
Participants in CATT with untreated active neovascular AMD (n = 1185).
Participants were interviewed for use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Trained readers evaluated photographs for the presence and size of retinal or subretinal hemorrhage at baseline and years 1 and 2. Associations between use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs and hemorrhage were evaluated among all participants and by baseline hypertension status using multivariate logistic regression models.
Odds ratio for association with antiplatelet or anticoagulant use.
Among 1165 participants with gradable photographs, 724 (62.1%) had retinal or subretinal hemorrhage at baseline; 84.4% of hemorrhages were 1 disc area (DA) or less, 8.1% were 1 to 2 DA, and 7.5% were more than 2 DA. At baseline, 608 participants (52.2%) used antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, including 514 participants (44.1%) using antiplatelets only, 77 (6.6%) using anticoagulants only, and 17 (1.5%) using both. Hemorrhage was present in 64.5% of antiplatelet or anticoagulant users and in 59.6% of nonusers (P = 0.09; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.51; P = 0.21). Neither presence nor size of baseline hemorrhage was associated with the type, dose, or duration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant use. Forty-four of 1078 participants (4.08%) had retinal or subretinal hemorrhage detected on 1- or 2-year photographs; these hemorrhages were not associated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant use at baseline (P = 0.28) or during follow-up (P = 0.64). Among participants with hypertension (n = 807), antiplatelet or anticoagulant use was associated with a higher rate of hemorrhage at baseline (66.8% vs. 56.4%; adjusted OR, 1.48; P = 0.01), but not size of retinal or subretinal hemorrhage (P = 0.41).
Most retinal or subretinal hemorrhages in eyes enrolled in CATT were less than 1 DA. Among all CATT participants, antiplatelet or anticoagulant use was not associated significantly with hemorrhage, but it was associated significantly with hemorrhage in participants with hypertension.
