To give an updated review of laser approaches to non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
PubMed and Medline database searches were carried out using the terms "laser" and "photocoagulation" associated with "age-related macular degeneration", and latest publications up to May 2017 have been reviewed. Moreover, the design of an ongoing single-center, non-randomized, phase I-II, pilot study, the PASCAL-GA trial, coordinated by F. Bandello, MD and G. Querques, MD from the IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, is described.
Either standard or subthreshold laser strategies have been tried to induce regression of distinct phenotypes of AMD, as reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), nascent geographic atrophy (nGA), and drusen-associated geographic atrophy (DAGA), with heterogeneous results. The aim of the PASCAL-GA protocol is to assess if subthreshold laser can restore the retinal pigment epithelium function in eyes with RPD and nGA offering a protective effect against extensive GA.
New-generation medical and surgical approaches, including subthreshold laser photocoagulation, may have some success in downstaging AMD.
