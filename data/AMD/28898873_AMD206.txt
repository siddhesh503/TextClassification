The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen using intravitreal injection of aflibercept (IVA) for typical age-related macular degeneration (tAMD).
We retrospectively studied 61 treatment-na√Øve eyes with tAMD. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), number of injections, and complications during 2 years were evaluated.
BCVA significantly improved by on average 0.13 logMAR units, and CMT and CCT significantly decreased after 2 years. The number of injections was on average 13.6. In the second year, eyes with classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) needed significantly fewer treatments than eyes with occult CNV. Fourteen eyes, which developed subfoveal fibrosis, showed significantly poorer BCVA after 2 years. Subfoveal fibrosis was significantly common in classic CNV.
A TAE regimen using IVA for tAMD might be effective for improving BCVA and exudative changes. The exudation may be suppressed with fewer treatments in classic CNV compared to occult CNV.
