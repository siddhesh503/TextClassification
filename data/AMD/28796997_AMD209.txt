To evaluate the dynamic changes of the aqueous humor levels of inflammatory factors between patients receiving intravitreal ranibizumab injection (IRI) and aflibercept injection (IAI) in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The study was performed on 30 eyes with AMD that were scheduled to receive 3 doses of IRI (15 eyes) or IAI (15 eyes) at monthly intervals. Aqueous humor samples were collected when injection was done. The concentrations of VEGF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 were measured in aqueous humor samples from the 30 AMD patients and 10 cataract patients (as controls) by the suspension array method.
Aqueous levels of the inflammatory factors (MCP-1, PDGF-AA, IL-6, and IL-8) were significantly correlated with each other. In both the IRI-treated eyes and the IAI-treated eyes, visual acuity and central macular thickness improved significantly, and the aqueous level of VEGF showed a significant decrease. In IAI-treated eyes, the aqueous levels of MCP-1 and PDGF-AA were significantly decreased at 2 months.
These findings suggest that the inflammatory factors are involved in the pathogenesis of AMD and also the possibility that the interaction between these inflammatory factors and IRI or IAI is different.
