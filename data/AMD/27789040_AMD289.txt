Aflibercept is indicated in France for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) since November 2013. Its official dosage consists in administrating one monthly intravitreal injection (IVT) during three months followed by one control visit and one IVT every two months the first year. In 2015, a group of French ophthalmologists, specialized in wAMD management, established a therapeutic algorithm to optimize naive patient management with aflibercept in order to obtain visual acuity gain. It indicates that official administration scheme is adapted for 80% of patients and that an adaptation of therapeutic scheme is needed for others. These experts recommended mostly the use of personalized proactive administration scheme. Since, aflibercept clinical use has significantly grown with interventional observational studies which results are now available. Use of aflibercept and of personalized proactive administration schemes allow in real-life obtaining important visual acuity gain, which is consistent with the established algorithm.
