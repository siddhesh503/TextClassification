The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and compare it with that of healthy controls. Additionally, our study aims to investigate the possible risk factors for poor quality of life in AMD patients.
Participants in the study were 114 patients with AMD, 63 male and 51 female, mean-aged 76.5 Â± 6.1 years. Demographic data, lifestyle factors, and medical history were recorded. All patients underwent a routine examination for AMD, including best-corrected visual acuity measurement, dilated fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography, and completed three questionnaires assessing quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D, NEI VFQ-25). In addition, 100 controls, adjusted for gender and age, were included in the study. Risk factors for quality of life in AMD patients were investigated. Univariate analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0.
Patients with AMD scored lower in vision- and health-related quality-of-life questionnaires compared to controls. Risk factors associated with quality of life in patients with AMD were found to be the female gender, alcohol consumption, the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, myosceletal problems, migraine, anxiety/depression, subretinal or intraretinal fluid, pigment epithelium detachment, previous treatment for AMD, visual acuity, the stage of the disease, and the integrity of the ellipsoid zone.
Patients with AMD presented lower quality of life in comparison with controls. Potential risk factors should be taken into account and clinicians should thus focus on the most vulnerable subgroups.
