To compare the differences in the clinical therapeutic effects on early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the treatment between <i>emayaoling</i> acupuncture technique and regular acupuncture.
A total of 110 patients of AMD were randomized into an observation group (55 cases, 73 eyes) and a control group (55 cases, 76 eyes). In the observation group, acupuncture was applied at Cuanzhu (BL 2) and Yiming (EX-HN 14). The needles were retained for 30 min. Additionally, Ganshu (BL 18), Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) were stimulated with quick needling technique. <i>Emayaoling</i> needling technique was applied. The needle was rotated with the thumb and index finger of the puncture hand, forward and backward. The strong and large amplitude were given when the thumb moved forward, and while, the week and small amplitude required when moving backward. The gentle movement was required in the entire procedure. In the control group, the point selection was same as the observation group. The points were stimulated with regular technique. The needle retaining time was same as the observation group. The treatment was given once every two days in the two groups and for 3 months continuously. The visit was followed up for 3 months. Before and after treatment, as well as at follow-up, the eyesight, the effect on macular area and the macular retinal structure [the macular nerve fiber layer (MNFL), retinal neurepithelium layer (RNL), pigment epithelium and choroid capillary composite lay (PECCL)] were evaluated separately.
1. After treatment and at follow-up, the eyesight was improved as compared with that before treatment in the two groups, indicating the significant difference (both <i>P</i><0.05). The differences in comparison before and after treatment, and in comparison of the follow-up with that before treatment, were improved in a larger amplitude in the observation group as compared with the control group, indicating the significant difference (both <i>P</i><0.05). 2. Regarding the therapeutic effects on macular area, after treatment and at follow-up, the total effective rates were 83.6% (61/73) and 86.3% (63/73) in the observation group and were 63.2% (48/76) and 67.1% (51/76) in the control group separately. The results in the observation group were higher than those in the control group, indicating the significant difference between the two groups (both <i>P</i><0.05). 3. Regarding the macular retinal structure, after treatment and at follow-up, the levels of MNFL, RNL and PECCL were all reduced as compared with those before treatment, indicating the significant difference (all <i>P</i><0.05). After treatment and at follow-up, the levels of MNFL, RNL and PECCL in the observation group were all lower than those in the control group, indicating the significant difference (all <i>P</i><0.05).
The <i>emayaoling</i> acupuncture technique achieves better clinical therapeutic effects on treatment of early AMD as compared with the regular acupuncture.
