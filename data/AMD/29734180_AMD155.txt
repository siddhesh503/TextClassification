To investigate the influence of the vitreoretinal interface on the outcomes of different ranibizumab regimens for exudative age-related macular degeneration.
We conducted a retrospective subanalysis of 2 prospective clinical trials. Patients were treated with ranibizumab for 12 months according to 3 different regimens: pro-re-nata (PRN), treat and extend (T&amp;E), and monthly. Vitreoretinal interface was assessed for absence (group ON) or presence (group OFF) of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
We included 64 eyes from 64 patients. Visual improvement was poorer for group ON (0.3 ± 10.7 letters) than for group OFF (9.2 ± 13.3; p = 0.007). A significant difference in letters of improvement between groups was observed in the PRN cohort (ON: -5.0 ± 12.9; OFF: 11.4 ± 11.9; p = 0.003), but not in the cohorts with monthly (ON: 5.7 ± 7.8; OFF: 7.9 ± 15.2; p = 0.735) or T&amp;E (ON: 4.3 ± 4.3; OFF: 7.8 ± 11.1; p = 0.424) treatment.
The negative impact of absence of PVD is regimen dependent, with monthly dosing providing similar outcomes to PVD patients. In the absence of PVD (group ON), PRN should be avoided, and T&amp;E might be an alternative.
