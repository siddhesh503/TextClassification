The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the risk factors in the residents aged ≥50 years in Hainan Province.
Random sampling was carried out in four separated cities in Hainan Province in 2015. All the subjects accomplished the standard questionnaire and ocular examinations. The diagnosis of AMD was performed based on the criteria proposed by Beckman Initiative for Macular Research Classification Committee.
Three hundred and fifty-seven subjects (15.6%) were diagnosed with AMD, including 267 (11.7%) of early AMD, 64 (2.80%) of intermediate AMD and 24 (1.1%) of late AMD, respectively. The factors associated with the prevalence of AMD included age, educational level, smoking, outdoor activities and diet. The prevalence of AMD increased with age, lower educational level, smoking or less outdoor activities. The prevalence of AMD in those with a diet of meat or eggs was higher compared with a diet of vegetables or fish. The prevalence of early, intermediate and late AMD in the aged population in Hainan Province was 11.7, 2.8 and 1.1%, respectively.
Age and smoking were the risk factors for AMD, while the educational level and outdoor activities were the protective factors. Early AMD mostly occurred in those aged 50-59 years and 60-69 years, while intermediate and late AMD occurred in 70-79 years and older than 80 years.
