The use of imaging for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) depends on how it benefits clinical management and on reimbursement. The latter should relate to the former. This review assesses how different forms of AMD can be imaged and what information this provides. For nonneovascular AMD high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT), autofluorescence, and near infrared imaging can identify the type of drusen, such as reticular pseudodrusen, which influences prognosis, and the amount of atrophy, for which phase 3 trials are underway. Clarifying the correct diagnosis for late-onset Stargardt and macular telangiectasia, if treatment becomes available, will be especially important. Choroidal thickness can be measured and changes with antiâ€’vascular endothelial growth factor treatment, but how this influences management is less clear. The finding of a thick choroid may alter the diagnosis to pachychoroid neovasculopathy, which may have a different treatment response. Peripheral retinal changes are commonly found on ultrawide-field imaging but their importance is not yet determined. The mainstay of imaging is OCT, which can detect neovascular AMD by detecting thickening and be used for follow-up, as the presence or absence of thickening is the main determinant of treatment. Higher resolution systems and now OCT angiography are able to distinguish neovascular type, especially type 2 choroidal neovascularization but also polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and retinal angiomatous proliferation. Fundus fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies still have a role, although that partly depends on whether photodynamic therapy is being considered. Automated image analysis and machine learning will be increasingly important in supporting clinician decisions.
