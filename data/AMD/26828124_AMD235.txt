To evaluate aqueous flare levels following intravitreal ranibizumab injection for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
In total, 81 eyes of 79 patients who underwent intravitreal ranibizumab injection for neovascular AMD were included. Aqueous flare was evaluated before pupillary dilatation with Kowa FM-600 laser flare meter at baseline, and 1 day, and 1 month after intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (0.05 mL).
The mean anterior chamber flare was 10.7 ± 6.8 (range: 1.5-35.4) ph/ms before the injection, 12.5 ± 8.9 (range: 0.3-43) ph/ms on the first day, and 9.9 ± 5.7 (range: 0.2-28.4) ph/ms in the first month. On the first day, a subtle increasing of flare was observed. However, the difference between the mean aqueous flare levels at baseline and postoperative first day and first month was not statistically different (p>0.05).
No significant short-term intraocular inflammation was noted in these eyes receiving ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular AMD.
