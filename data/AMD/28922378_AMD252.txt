To measure visual acuity and metamorphopsia in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to explore their relationship with macular lesions.
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 32 normal subjects (32 eyes) and 35 AMD patients (35 eyes) were recruited. They were categorized into 4 groups: normal, dry AMD, non-active wet AMD, and active wet AMD. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol. Metamorphopsia was quantified with the orientation discrimination threshold (ODT). Macular lesions, including drusen, sub-retinal fluid (SRF), intra-retinal fluid (IRF), pigmented epithelium detachment (PED), and scarring, were identified with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). A linear regression model was established to identify the relationships between the functional and structural changes.
BCVA progressively worsened across the normal, dry AMD, non-active wet AMD, and active wet AMD groups (P < 0.001), and ODT increased across the groups (P < 0.001). The correlation between BCVA and ODT varied among the groups. The partial correlation between BCVA and ODT was -0.61 (P < 0.001). Linear regression showed that ODT significantly depended on IRF (β = 0.61, P < 0.001), SRF (β = 0.34, P = 0.003), and scarring (β = 0.26, P = 0.050), while BCVA significantly depended only on scarring (β = -0.52, P < 0.001), and IRF (β = -0.36, P = 0.016).
From dry AMD to active wet AMD, BCVA gradually worsened while ODT increased. The correlation between BCVA and ODT varied among these groups, indicating that AMD lesions affect them differently. ODT and BCVA should be used concurrently for better monitoring of the disease.
