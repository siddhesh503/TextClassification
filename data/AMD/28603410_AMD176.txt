Macular hole (MH) is part of a group of age-related degenerative diseases characterized by pathology of vitreomacular interface. Similarly, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) affects older patients and is a leading cause of irreversible visual loss. The purpose of this case series is to describe the development of full-thickness MH in patients with nAMD, following antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment.
Participants in this case series were four patients with nAMD, who received anti-VEGF injections with variable therapeutic response to treatment. Patients were examined at baseline (when AMD was diagnosed) and monthly thereafter. The examination included visual acuity measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and optical coherence tomography.
All patients were found to develop full-thickness MH within 1-4 months after the last anti-VEGF injection, even in the absence of pre-existing vitreomacular interface abnormalities in some cases. The median number of injections before the MH formation was 3.
MH formation may represent an adverse effect of anti-VEGF treatment in patients with nAMD and could be also coexisting pathology with nAMD in older individuals.
