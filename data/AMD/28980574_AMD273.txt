With account to the increase in the elderly population in most of the developed countries, the WHO defines age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as one of the main causes of blindness in the world. A large percentage of disability is accounted for by exudative, or neovascular, form of AMD. Today, a total of 5 anti-VEGF drugs exist that are recommended for treatment of exudative AMD: pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept, and conbercept. Despite significant progress in the treatment of neovascular AMD yielded by the introduction into clinical practice of anti-VEGF drugs, some patients report a lack (down to complete lack) of response with standard treatment patterns and even a decrease in treatment efficacy after repeated intravitreal injections.
