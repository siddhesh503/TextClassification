The aim of this paper was to assess and compare the effects of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab on retinal vessel diameter in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Patients with neovascular AMD who underwent intravitreal injection of either ranibizumab or bevacizumab were included. Noninjected fellow eyes served as a control. The main outcome measures were central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), and the artery-vein ratio (AVR).
In the ranibizumab group, the mean CRAE value decreased significantly at 1 week and 1 month (p = 0.002). The AVR value decreased significantly at 1 month (p = 0.028). CRVE values did not change at 1 week and 1 month (p = 0.083). In the bevacizumab group, the preinjection CRAE, CRVE, and AVR values did not change through the study period (p = 0.128, p = 0.600, and p = 0.734, respectively).
These results suggest that intravitreal ranibizumab led to significant retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction in eyes with neovascular AMD.
