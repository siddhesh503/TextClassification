To evaluate the 6-month safety and efficacy of ziv-aflibercept intravitreal injections for treating exudative age-related macular degeneration.
Fifteen patients with unilateral exudative age-related macular degeneration were enrolled. The best-corrected visual acuity was measured and spectral domain optical coherence tomography was performed at baseline and monthly. Full-field electroretinography and multifocal electroretinography were obtained at baseline and 4, 13, and 26 weeks after the first injection. All patients received three monthly intravitreal injections of ziv-aflibercept (1.25 mg) followed by as-needed treatment.
Between baseline and 26 weeks, the mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity improved (P = 0.00408) from 0.93 ± 0.4 (20/200) to 0.82 ± 0.5 (20/160) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, respectively; the central retinal thickness decreased significantly (P = 0.0007) from 490.3 ± 155.1 microns to 327.9 ± 101.5 microns; the mean total macular volume decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) from 9.51 ± 1.36 mm to 8.08 ± 1.34 mm, and the a-wave implicit time increased, with no differences in the other full-field electroretinography parameters. The average multifocal electroretinography macular responses within the first central 15° showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased P1 amplitudes at 26 weeks. No systemic or ocular complications developed.
Intravitreal ziv-aflibercept significantly improved the best-corrected visual acuity, multifocal electroretinography amplitudes, central retinal thickness, and total macular volume from baseline to 26 weeks. No retinal toxicity on full-field electroretinography or adverse events occurred during the follow-up period.
