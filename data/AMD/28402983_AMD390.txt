The aim of this study was to clarify the 1-year outcomes of pro re nata (PRN) and bimonthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept (IVA) for typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration (tAMD) after the initial 3 monthly IVA.
We conducted a prospective, interventional study. Fifty-eight treatment-na√Øve patients with tAMD were randomly assigned to the PRN (30 patients) or the bimonthly (28 patients) treatment group. Both groups initially received 3 monthly IVA. Visual acuity, central macular retinal thickness (CRT), and central choroidal thickness (CCT) were evaluated at 12 months. Subanalysis was performed to identify factors associated with the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
BCVA was significantly improved only in the bimonthly group at 12 months. CRT and CCT were significantly decreased in both groups. Subanalysis showed that the only factor associated with BCVA improvement at 12 months was the existence of pigment epithelial detachment at baseline.
BCVA showed significant improvement only in the bimonthly group but not in the PRN group at 12 months.
