To evaluate the relationship between morphological changes and functional improvements assessed using focal macular electroretinograms after intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) injections in eyes with wet age-related macular degeneration.
The clinical records of 42 eyes of 42 consecutive patients with naive, wet age-related macular degeneration received 3 monthly IVA were reviewed. The best-corrected visual acuity, central foveal thickness, outer retinal thickness, inner retinal thickness at baseline and 1 month after each IVA, and focal macular electroretinograms at baseline and 1 month after the first and third IVA were compared.
Best-corrected visual acuity was improved after the third IVA (P = 0.0091). Central foveal thickness and outer retinal thickness showed decreases after every IVA (P < 0.001, respectively). Inner retinal thickness showed a decrease after the second IVA (P = 0.002), after and third IVA (P = 0.001). On focal macular electroretinograms, a- and b-wave amplitudes showed increases after the third IVA (P = 0.0028, P = 0.0012, respectively). Significant correlations were observed between best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness, a-wave amplitude and outer retinal thickness, and b-wave amplitude and inner retinal thickness changes after the third IVA.
All parameters significantly recovered after three monthly IVA, with a correlation between functional improvements and morphological changes.
