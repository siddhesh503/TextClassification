Drusen have been considered the clinical hallmark of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), although first described about 25 years ago, have only been recently recognized as an additional clinical phenotype of AMD with distinct characteristics on multimodal imaging and significant impact on visual function. Eyes with RPD are at greater risk of progression to advanced AMD when compared with eyes with drusen only. RPD can also occur in the absence of drusen. Unlike features external to the retinal pigment epithelium that have received most attention in AMD, evidence suggests that RPD are associated with changes internal to the RPE. Therefore, new avenues regarding the pathogenesis of AMD are highlighted by these recent observations. We summarize the current knowledge regarding the histology, imaging, and functional changes in eyes with RPD in AMD and offer concepts of future research for the AMD community to discuss.
