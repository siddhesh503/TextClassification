This retrospective cohort study utilized 3 imaging modalities to analyze quantitatively reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) area changes in eyes that progressed from early to late age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Subjects with AMD, unilateral choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and early AMD with RPD in the fellow eye (the study eye) were included. The study eyes underwent indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), near-infrared reflectance (NIR-R), and short-wavelength autofluorescence (AF) imaging of the macula at baseline and at follow-up. Study eyes were analyzed for RPD and for the development of late AMD-CNV and/or geographic atrophy (GA). RPD area was measured at baseline and at follow-up as a percentage of the 30-degree field.
During the study period (mean follow-up time 23.5 ± 5.0 months), 12/31 study eyes developed CNV and 4/31 developed GA. In the eyes that developed CNV, there was a statistically significant decrease in mean RPD area over the follow-up period as seen on AF (P < 0.01) and NIR-R (P = 0.01), and the decrease in mean RPD area approached statistical significance on ICGA (P = 0.08).
Using 3 en face imaging techniques, we demonstrate that RPD undergo dynamic spatiotemporal changes in eyes that progress from early AMD to CNV, namely a decrease in the area of lesions detected.
