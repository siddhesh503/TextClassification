Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population in the Western world. AMD is a clinically heterogeneous disease presenting with drusen, pigmentary changes, geographic atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization. Due to its heterogeneous presentation, it can be challenging to distinguish AMD from several macular diseases that can mimic the features of AMD. This clinical overlap may potentially lead to misdiagnosis. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of AMD and the macular dystrophies that can mimic AMD. The appropriate use of clinical and genetic analysis can aid the clinician to establish the correct diagnosis, and to provide the patient with the appropriate prognostic information. An overview is presented of overlapping and distinguishing clinical features.
