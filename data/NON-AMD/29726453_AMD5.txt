Diabesity, a combination of diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity, is one of the biggest global health problems. Individual nutrition therapy and physical activity are effective measures in prevention and treatment.
Requirements for an integrated diabesity service were specified and evaluated in two stages. The aim of the first stage was to perform a feasibility trial in patients with diabesity, using separate diaries. DiabMemory for diabetes and Nutrinaut for nutrition. Based on the results of the first stage, a prototype of an integrated diabesity solution (KIT-Nutriton, AIT) was developed and evaluated.
First stage trial was performed with 10 diabesity patients (2f, med:53 y. (IQR:7), T2DM, BMI &gt; 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with 3 months follow-up and a significant reduction of BMI. Participants noticed concerns about using two separate diary solutions. Results of the field trial with KIT-Nutrition with 14 healthy subjects (3f, med:26 y (IQR: 20,25)) showed that overall, 77.6% of the intended tasks had been achieved.
Results show that the integrated KIT-Nutrition app, providing access to a nutrition database, is feasible and accepted by the users. Before further trials can be made, an extension for regional food terms is recommended.
