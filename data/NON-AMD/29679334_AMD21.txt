Bariatric surgery is used to induce weight loss (baros = weight). Evidence has shown that bariatric surgery improves the comorbid conditions associated with obesity such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM. Hence, shifting towards using metabolic surgery instead of bariatric surgery is currently more appropriate in certain subset of patients. Endocrine changes resulting from operative manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract after metabolic surgery translate into metabolic benefits with respect to the comorbid conditions. Other changes include bacterial flora rearrangement, bile acids secretion, and adipose tissue effect. The aim of this systematic review is to examine clinical trials regarding long-term effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery on patients with T2DM and to evaluate the potential mechanisms leading to the improvement in the glycaemic control.
