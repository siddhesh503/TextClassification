There is increasing recognition of association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolic syndrome is common in both NAFLD and cardiovascular diseases. Our study is designed to investigate the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular disease.
It's a cross-sectional study which included 104 patients of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. Those patients having secondary causes of steatosis were excluded. Complete cardiovascular evaluation which included assessment of metabolic syndrome, routine biochemistries, viral markers, Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen, hs-CRP and TNF-α levels were obtained for all patients.
Of all patients with cardiovascular disease, 19.2% (20/104) had essential hypertension with hypertensive heart disease the remaining 80.8% (84/104) patients had ischemic heart disease (IHD). On USG 69.2% (72/104) had NAFLD, these 50% (36/72) had grade 1 NAFLD and the rest grade 2 NAFLD. The hs-CRP levels and TNF-α were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD (p-value <0.001) and within patients with NAFLD the levels were higher in patients with grade 2 NAFLD. Also, binary logistic regression showed that high body-mass index (BMI), raised serum triglyceride levels, increased waist circumference and hypertension were significantly associated with the presence of NAFLD.
Our data indicates that NALD is highly prevalent in patients of cardiovascular disease (69.2%) and is significantly associated with metabolic syndrome and its individual components. The levels of hs-CRP and TNF-α were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD and showed an increasing trend with the severity of fatty liver.
