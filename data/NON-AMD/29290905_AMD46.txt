Pelvic kidney is a relatively common renal malformation as well as duplex kidney; however, the unilateral coexistence of these abnormalities is not frequently found. We present a case of a young woman with a history of hypertension in whom a pelvic and dysmorphic left kidney was discovered during ultrasound examination performed for the study of the renal arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography imaging revealed a duplex pelvic kidney. This combination is very rare; we have not found a similar case reported in the literature.
