As there were a few studies on the mental disorders resulting from diabetes in children, this study aimed at investigating the prevalence of psychological disorders among children.
We enrolled 323 children with diabetes type 1 aged 5-12 yr old referring to Endocrinology Clinic of Mofid Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2014-2015. In addition, 317 healthy children were considered as control group. The materials used for data analysis were information form and questionnaire CSI-4 filled out by their parents. The filled questionnaires were rated in that day and then analyzed and diagnosed by the Pediatric Psychiatrist in order to determine the type and intensity of psychological disorder. Results were analyzed using SPSS 20. <i>T</i> tests, Scheffe post hoc test and Pearson's correlation test were used for analysis of data. The amounts were significantly different at <i>P</i><0.05.
In terms of Neuro-Evolutionary disorders, Attention-deficit (ADD), hyperactivity (HD) and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in children with diabetes were significantly higher than those in healthy children (<i>P</i>=0.001). Severe fundamental depressive disorders were higher in diabetic children (<i>P</i>=0.001). In terms of anxiety disorder, a specific phobia and panic was significantly higher in diabetic children (<i>P</i>=0.005). Regarding aggressive behaviors, diabetic children were more disobedient and stubborn than the others.
