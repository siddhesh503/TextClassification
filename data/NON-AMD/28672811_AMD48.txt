Previous studies have suggested the potential involvement of oxidative stress in gastrointestinal cancers. In light of this, research efforts have been focused on the potential of dietary antioxidant intake to prevent gastrointestinal cancer through the modulation of oxidative stress. Rice bran, a by-product of rice milling, has been shown to contain an abundance of phytochemicals, which are dietary antioxidants. To date, a number of studies have shown the antioxidative effect of rice bran intake, and some demonstrated that such an effect may contribute to gastrointestinal cancer prevention, largely through the antioxidative properties of rice bran phytochemicals. In addition, these phytochemicals were shown to provide protection against cancer through mechanisms linked to oxidative stress, including Î²-catenin-mediated cell proliferation and inflammation. The present article provides an overview of current evidence for the antioxidative properties of rice bran and its phytochemicals, and for the potential of such properties in cancer prevention through the oxidative-stress-linked mechanisms mentioned above. The article also highlights the need for an evaluation of the effectiveness of rice bran dietary interventions among cancer survivors in ameliorating oxidative stress and reducing the level of gastrointestinal cancer biomarkers, thereby establishing the potential of such interventions among these individuals in the prevention of cancer recurrence.
