Chemerin is believed to be a mediator for the adipose tissue inflammation that occurs in obesity. The present study compared chemerin levels between healthy and type 2 diabetic women matched for age and body composition. We also aimed to assess the relationship of serum chemerin levels with body composition, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and diabesity.
This observational case-control study was conducted at the Departments of Physiology and Medicine, Saud University Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from September 2013 to April 2014. A total of 100 subjects were recruited, including 51 adult diabetic females, and a control group consisting of 49 healthy females. Finally, 80 subjects were selected as per inclusion criteria. In the finally selected group, 45 of were type 2 diabetics and 35 were healthy subjects matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and body composition with age ranging between 30-65 years. Body composition analysis was estimated using bioelectrical impendence analyzer. Fasting venous blood samples were analyzed for glycemic markers, lipids, and chemerin. Insulin resistance and sensitivity indices were calculated by HOMA-IR and QUICKI using standard formulas.
The two groups were matched for age, BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), basal metabolic rate (BMR), truncal fat and waist hip ratio (WHR). Serum chemerin levels were higher in diabetics than controls (p=0.001). Systolic blood pressure, weight, fat mass and visceral fat were found to be significantly higher in diabetics when compared to controls. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in diabetics compared to controls. While QUICKI and HDL were significantly lower in diabetics compared to controls. Chemerin levels correlated positively with age (r=0.300, p=0.007), waist hip ratio (r=0.250, p=0.026), weight (r=0.270, p=0.016), BMI (r=0.334, p=0.003), BF% (r=0.325, p=0.003), fat mass (r=0.250, p=0.026), visceral fat (r=0.356, p=0.001), truncal fat mass (r=0.245, p=0.030), truncal fat % (r=0.249, p=0.027), serum basal insulin levels (r=0.354, p=0.001) and HOMA IR (0.275, p=0.015), while it correlated inversely with QUICKI (r=-0.283*, p=0.012). In multiple linear regression analysis age (r=0.236, p=0.023), BF% (r=0.265, p=0.014) and basal insulin levels (r=0.265, p=0.014) were independent predictors of chemerin.
Serum chemerin levels are elevated in patients with type 2 DM compared to healthy control subjects and are positively correlated with adiposity and Insulin resistance in patients with type 2 DM.
