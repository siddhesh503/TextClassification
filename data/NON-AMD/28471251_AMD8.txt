MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs and have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression. Some miRNAs play important roles in regulating the function of the immune system and are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Recent studies suggested that microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) was able to regulate the function of several types of immune cells and may be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases. We systematically reviewed relevant literatures to provide a comprehensive review of the possible roles of miR-22-3p in autoimmune diseases. Published studies suggest that miR-22-3p can act as a novel regulator of autoimmune diseases via several pathways. More studies are needed to further elucidate the exact roles of miR-22-3p in autoimmune diseases. Treatment strategy targeting miR-22-3p is also a promising therapy for autoimmune diseases.
