Type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with obesity, or "diabesity", coincides with an altered nitric oxide (NO) metabolism in skeletal muscle. Three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) exist in human skeletal muscle tissue. Both neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are constitutively expressed under physiological conditions, producing low levels of NO, while the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is strongly up-regulated only under pathophysiological conditions, excessively increasing NO concentrations. Due to chronic inflammation, overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients exhibit up-regulated protein contents of iNOS and concomitant elevated amounts of NO in skeletal muscle. Low muscular NO levels are important for attaining an adequate cellular redox state--thereby maintaining metabolic integrity--while high NO levels are believed to destroy cellular components and to disturb metabolic processes, e.g., through strongly augmented posttranslational protein S-nitrosylation. Physical training with submaximal intensity has been shown to attenuate inflammatory profiles and iNOS protein contents in the long term. The present review summarizes signaling pathways which induce iNOS up-regulation under pathophysiological conditions and describes molecular mechanisms by which high NO concentrations are likely to contribute to triggering skeletal muscle insulin resistance and to reducing mitochondrial capacity during the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. Based on this information, it discusses the beneficial effects of regular physical exercise on the altered NO metabolism in the skeletal muscle of overweight/obese type 2 diabetic subjects, thus unearthing new perspectives on training strategies for this particular patient group.
