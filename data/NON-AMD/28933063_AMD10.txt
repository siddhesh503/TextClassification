It is widely accepted that high calorie diets and a sedentary lifestyle sturdily influence the incidence and outcome of type 2 diabetes and obesity, which can occur simultaneously, a situation called diabesity. Tightly linked with metabolic and energy regulation, a close association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed. Among the common pathogenic mechanisms that underpin both conditions, insulin resistance, brain glucose hypometabolism, and metabolic dyshomeostasis appear to have a pivotal role. This century is an unprecedented diabetogenic period in human history, so therapeutic strategies and/or approaches to control and/or revert this evolving epidemic is of utmost importance. This chapter will make a brief contextualization about the impact that diabetes and obesity can exert in brain structure and function alongside with a brief survey about the role of insulin in normal brain function, exploring its roles in cognition and brain glucose metabolism. Later, attention will be given to the intricate relation of diabesity, insulin resistance, and AD. Finally, both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions will also be reviewed as strategies aimed at fighting diabesity and/or AD-related metabolic effects.
