To investigate the risk of postoperative complications in elderly colorectal cancer patients over 65 years with comorbid cardiovascular diseases.
A total of 381 elderly colorectal cancer patients over 65 years were pathologically diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinoma and underwent the first surgery in Beijing Hospital during January 2013 and December 2014. Patients were divided into comorbid cardiovascular disease group (258 cases) and non-cardiovascular disease group (123 cases) according to the existence of comorbid cardiovascular disease. The morbidity of postoperative complication was compared between two groups.
There was no significant difference in the morbidity of postoperative complication between two groups [27.9%(72/258) vs. 29.3%(36/123), P>0.05]. According to the Clavien-Dindo classification of postoperative complications, the morbidities of complication at all levels between two groups were not significantly different(all P>0.05). But in terms of cardiovascular complications, the morbidity of comorbid cardiovascular disease group was significantly higher than that of non-cardiovascular disease group [7.4%(19/258) vs. 0.8%(1/123), χ<sup>2</sup>=6.678, P=0.010], while no significant differences in pulmonary and abdominal complications were found between two groups(all P>0.05). The morbidities of other complications (deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection and renal complications, etc.) of comorbid cardiovascular disease group were lower than those in non-cardiovascular disease group [2.7%(7/258) vs. 8.1%(10/123), χ<sup>2</sup>=5.733, P=0.017]. Different types of cardiovascular diseases, different levels of cardiac risk index and American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) rating were not significantly related to the patient's occurrence of postoperative complications(all P>0.05).
Surgery treatment for elderly colorectal cancer patients over 65 years with comorbid cardiovascular diseases is safe. However, strict cardiovascular monitoring should be performed and necessary measures should be carried out in time.
