Macrophage-related inflammatory response is one of the main biological factors resulting in failure of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, although the specific pathomechanism remains to be clarified. Our aim was to investigate the association between graft loosening and macrophage-related inflammation in cases of loosening of reconstructed ACL autografts. Tissue samples were obtained from 21 patients who underwent a second-look arthroscopy within the first year after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using single-bundle hamstring tendon autografts. Possible biological factors of graft loosening were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and hematoxylin/eosin and immunohistochemical staining of graft tissue samples obtained during the second-look arthroscopy. Graft loosening was closely related to increased gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8) and activation of the inflammation-related toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (TLR2 and TLR4). The molecular expression of TGF-β and type I and III collagen was also inhibited to varying degrees, with decreased vascularization of the graft due to an inhibition of VEGF. iNOS, a marker of M1 macrophage activation, was highly expressed in cases of graft loosening, with no effect of M2 macrophages identified. The activation of M1 macrophages and aseptic inflammation signaling is an important biological factor of graft loosening after ACL reconstruction, affecting ligamentization and the health of grafts.
