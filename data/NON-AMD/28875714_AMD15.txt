Data on the individual nephrotoxic effects of imidacloprid (IMI) and gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) are scarce. Moreover, there is a lack of information about their combined effects on the renal tissue. Our study investigated the effects of IMI and GA<sub>3</sub> separately or together on rats kidney. IMI (64 mg/kg bw) was given for 3 weeks by gavage either individually or in combination with GA<sub>3</sub> (200 mg/L) via drinking water. IMI associated or no with GA<sub>3</sub> increased the levels of kidney malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, protein carbonyls and metallothionein, plasma creatinine, urea, blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase activity. A decline of kidney uric acid level and antioxidant status was also observed. All these changes were supported by histopathological observations. Our results highlighted the role of IMI and/or GA<sub>3</sub>-induced nephrotoxicity. Co-exposure to IMI and GA<sub>3</sub> exhibited synergism in biochemical kidney variables and histopathology and antagonism in physical and morphological parameters.
