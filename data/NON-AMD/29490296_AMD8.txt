Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of postoperative renal allograft dysfunction, which is mainly the result of proinflammatory reactions including inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Resveratrol (RSV) plays an important role in protecting various organs in IRI because it reduces oxidative stress, lessens the inflammatory response, and exerts anti-apoptotic effects. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the renoprotective effect of RSV in inhibiting inflammatory responses, reducing oxidative stress, and decreasing cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.
RSV was administered before renal ischemia and H2O2 induction. Serum and kidneys were harvested 24 h after reperfusion and NRK-52E cells were collected 4 h after H2O2 stimulation. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were used to assess renal function. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess histological injury. Quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to assess proinflammatory cytokine expression. Oxidative stress-related proteins, such as Nrf2 and TLR4, were evaluated by western blot. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay was used to detect apoptotic cells in tissues, and western blot was used to evaluate the expression of caspase-3, -8, and -9 in this study.
RSV inhibited inflammatory responses and improved renal function after renal IRI. Additionally, RSV decreased oxidative stress and reduced cell apoptosis by upregulating Nrf2 expression, downregulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, and by decreasing caspase-3 activity and caspase cascades.
Our study demonstrated the mechanisms underlying RSV renoprotection. We found that RSV exerts its greatest effects by blocking inflammatory responses, lowering oxidative stress, and reducing apoptosis via the Nrf2/TLR4/NF-κB pathway.
