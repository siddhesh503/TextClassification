This study aimed to explore whether functional CYP2D6 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.
A meta-analysis was conducted on associations between autoimmune diseases and functional CYP2D6*4 1934 A/G and *3 polymorphisms and CYP2D6 phenotypes.
Twelve studies with 1,472 patients and 3,328 controls were included. Autoimmune disease and the CYP2D6 1934 A allele were significantly associated in the overall group, consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (OR = 1.227, 95% CI = 1.071-1.406, p = 0.003); stratification by ethnicity indicated that the CYP2D6 1934 A allele and autoimmune diseases were associated in Caucasians (OR = 1.225, 95% CI = 1.010-1.485, p = 0.039). The CYP2D6*3 allele was also associated with autoimmune diseases in Caucasians (OR = 1.977, 95% CI = 1.125-3.472, p = 0.018). Stratified by autoimmune disease type revealed that the CYP2D6 1934 AA genotype was associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OR = 2.007, 95% CI = 1.170-3.442, p = 0.011) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS; OR = 2.317, 95% CI = 1.422-3.774, p = 0.001). The CYP2D6 PM+IM phenotype was significantly associated with autoimmune diseases in Caucasians (OR = 1.526, 95% CI = 1.038-2.246, p = 0.032) and with SLE (OR = 1.778, 95% CI = 1.249-2.532, p = 0.001).
This meta-analysis indicates that CYP2D6*4 and *3 polymorphisms and the CYP2D6 phenotype are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases in Caucasians; particularly, the CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and CYP2D6 PM+IM phenotype are risk factors for SLE development.
