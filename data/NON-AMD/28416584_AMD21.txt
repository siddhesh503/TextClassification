Cytochrome P450 1B1 protects against angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and associated cardiovascular changes in female mice, most likely via production of 2-methoxyestradiol. This study was conducted to determine whether 2-methoxyestradiol ameliorates Ang II-induced hypertension, renal dysfunction, and end-organ damage in intact <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup>, ovariectomized female, and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> male mice. Ang II or vehicle was infused for 2 weeks and administered concurrently with 2-methoxyestradiol. Mice were placed in metabolic cages on day 12 of Ang II infusion for urine collection for 24 hours. 2-Methoxyestradiol reduced Ang II-induced increases in systolic blood pressure, water consumption, urine output, and proteinuria in intact female <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and ovariectomized mice. 2-Methoxyestradiol also reduced Ang II-induced increase in blood pressure, water intake, urine output, and proteinuria in <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> male mice. Treatment with 2-methoxyestradiol attenuated Ang II-induced end-organ damage in intact <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and ovariectomized <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> female mice and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> male mice. 2-Methoxyestradiol mitigated Ang II-induced increase in urinary excretion of angiotensinogen in intact <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and ovariectomized <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> female mice but not in <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> male mice. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 antagonist G-15 failed to alter Ang II-induced increases in blood pressure and renal function in <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> female mice. These data suggest that 2-methoxyestradiol reduces Ang II-induced hypertension and associated end-organ damage in intact <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup>, ovariectomized <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>-/-</sup> female mice, and <i>Cyp1b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> male mice independent of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1. Therefore, 2-methoxyestradiol could serve as a therapeutic agent for treating hypertension and associated pathogenesis in postmenopausal females, and in males.
