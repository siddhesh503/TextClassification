Increasing evidence indicates that obesity is highly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist has shown benefits on kidney diseases, but its direct role on kidney metabolism in obesity is still not clear. This study aims to investigate the protection and metabolic modulation role of liraglutide (Lira) on kidney of obesity. Rats were induced obese by high-fat diet (HFD), and renal function and metabolism changes were evaluated by metabolomic, biological and histological methods. HFD rats exhibited systemic metabolic disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as renal histological and function damages, while Lira significantly ameliorated these adverse effects in HFD rats. Metabolomic data showed that Lira directly reduced renal lipids including fatty acid residues, cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides, and improved mitochondria metabolites such as succinate, citrate, taurine, fumarate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the kidney of HFD rats. Furthermore, we revealed that Lira inhibited renal lipid accumulation by coordinating lipogenic and lipolytic signals, and partly rescued renal mitochondria function via Sirt1/AMPK/PGC1Î± pathways in HFD rats. This study suggested that Lira alleviated HFD-induced kidney injury at least partly via directly restoring renal metabolism, thus GLP-1R agonist is a promising therapy for obesity-associated CKD.
