To investigate the impact of miRNA (microRNA) on hepatic oxidative stress damage under the human mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium (MSC-CM) and explore the roles of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) in this process.
Hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress injury in the human normal liver cell line L02. MSC-CM was separately prepared. After treatment with MSC-CM, the protective effects of MSC-CM on oxidative stress injury were assessed by changes in apoptosis, cell viability, cell cycle, and mitochondrial membrane potential. According to the microarray analysis, 19 disparately expressed miRNAs were selected for RT-PCR and miR143 identified as having significant differential expression in MSC-CM against oxidative stress injury. Subsequently, the predicted target proteins of miR143 were selected by bioinformatics software, and verified by western blot. In addition, down-regulation and up-regulation of miR143 expression and hydrogen peroxide induced hypoxia injury were carried out on L02 cells to study the role of miR143.
MSC-CM significantly attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced oxidative stress injury. The expression of miR143 was increased following oxidative stress injury whereas it decreased after MSC-CM treatment. The expression levels of HK2 and ADRB1 regulated by miR143 and Bcl-2 decreased under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment but were restored following MSC-CM treatment. However the expression levels of Bax and BMF increased after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> injury and decreased after MSC-CM treatment. Moreover over-expression or down-regulation of miR143 aggravated or alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis respectively.
MSC-CM may alleviate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced oxidative stress injury by inhibiting apoptosis and adjusting miRNA expression. Moreover down-regulation of miR143 protects L02 cells from apoptosis and initiates an adaptive process by adjusting the expression of HK2 ADRB1 and apoptosis-related proteins.
