A putative protective effect of cHb and cWb against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage was evaluated in detail using MRC-5 cells. In addition, the carrageenan (Carr)-induced mouse paw edema model and the cotton pellet-induced granuloma model were employed to examine the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of cHb and cWb in mice. It was demonstrated that both cHb and cWb treatments significantly increased cell viability and inhibited morphology alterations in MRC-5 cells exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Orally administered cHb and cWb significantly reduced Carr-induced paw edema volume and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation. Moreover, cHb and cWb decreased the expression levels of important pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), while only cWb was found to increase the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 significantly. Finally, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) in the liver improved after cHb and cWb treatment under acute and chronic inflammation. Taken collectively, the results of this study suggest that both cHb and cWb protect against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage in fibroblast cells. Moreover, cHb and cWb were found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in both the acute and chronic stages of inflammation and appear to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity and decrease lipid peroxidation in the livers of mice. Therefore, this study indicates that cHb and cWb have great potential to be used in the development of dietary supplements for the prevention of oxidative stress related to inflammatory disorders.
