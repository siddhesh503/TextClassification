Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function and an antigen-independent inflammatory process that causes tissue damage, which was one of the main manifestations of kidney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Recent studies have demonstrated autophagy participated in the pathological process of acute kidney injury. In this study, we discuss how autophagy regulated inflammation response in the kidney I/R. AKI was performed by renal I/R. Autophagy activator rapamycin (Rap) and inhibitor 3-methyladenine (MA) were used to investigate the role of autophagy on kidney function and inflammation response. After the experiment, kidney tissues were obtained for the detection of autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3(LC3)II, Beclin1, and Rab7 and lysosome-associated membrane protein type (LAMP)2 protein by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) and Western blotting, and histopathology and tissue injury scores also. The blood was harvested to measure kidney function (creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels) after I/R. Cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1, and IL-10 were measured after I/R. I/R induced the expression of LC3II, Beclin1, LAMP2, and Rab7. The activation and inhibition of autophagy by rapamycin and 3-MA were promoted and attenuated histological and renal function in renal I/R rats, respectively. Cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and HMGB1 were decreased, and IL-10 was further increased after activation of autophagy treated in I/R rats, while 3-MA exacerbated the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in renal I/R. I/R can activated the autophagy, and autophagy increase mitigated the renal injury by decreasing kidney injury score, levels of Cr and BUN after renal I/R, and inflammation response via regulating the balance of pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation cytokines.
