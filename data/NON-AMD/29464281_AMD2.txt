Scedosporium species are opportunistic pathogens causing a great variety of infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. The Scedosporium genus ranks the second among the filamentous fungi colonizing the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), after Aspergillus fumigatus, and most species are capable to chronically colonize the respiratory tract of these patients. Nevertheless, few data are available regarding evasion of the inhaled conidia to the host immune response. Upon microbial infection, macrophages and neutrophils release reactive oxygen species (ROS). To colonize the respiratory tract, the conidia need to germinate despite the oxidative stress generated by phagocytic cells. Germination of spores from different clinical or environmental isolates of the major Scedosporium species was investigated in oxidative stress conditions. All tested species showed susceptibility to oxidative stress. However, when comparing clinical and environmental isolates, differences in germination capabilities under oxidative stress conditions were seen between species as well as within each species. Among environmental isolates, Scedosporium aurantiacum isolates were the most resistant to oxidative stress whereas Scedosporium dehoogii were the most susceptible. Overall, the differences observed between Scedosporium species in the capacity to germinate under oxidative stress conditions could explain their varying prevalence and pathogenicity.
