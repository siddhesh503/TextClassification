Mounting studies have indicated the role of berberine, SIRT1, and oxidative stress in diabetes, respectively. However, few studies have demonstrated their correlation and regulation function in diabetes. Therefore, the protective effect of berberine in diabetic and the underlying core mechanism were investigated in the current study. Diabetic mice model in vivo were established. Mouse pancreatic beta-cell line NIT-1 cells were treated with 30 mM high glucose to induce diabetic condition in vitro. Serum biochemical parameters (glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) were detected. Oxidative stress indicators (MDA, SOD1), along with miR-106b and SIRT1 expression in islets and cells were also assessed. Direct targeting relationship between miR-106b and SIRT1 was discussed by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Diabetic model in vivo and in vitro were both established successfully. The expression of serum biochemical parameters was increased, and oxidative stress parameters, and miR-106b, SIRT1 were abnormally expressed in diabetic mice and NIT-1 cells. Meanwhile, berberine could alleviate oxidative stress injury in diabetic progression. Through dual luciferase reporter gene assay, we found that SIRT1 was a target gene of miR-106b. In addition, miR-106b over-expression could reverse the protection of berberine in NIT-1 cells against from oxidative stress induced by high glucose. Berberine could attenuate oxidative stress of diabetic mice at least partly through miR-106b/SIRT1 pathway and affecting the function of islets, which might be beneficial in reducing the cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes.
