Diabesity is the leading cause of modern, chronic disease. In 2012, diabetes killed 1.2 million people worldwide and its global prevalence exceeded 347 million people, and it is expected that it will increase to 540 million by 2030. Because of this health imperative, it is also linked to increasing obesity. The role of the inflammatory process and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of these diseases is widely documented. This paper review, using data from major databases, the role of biopeptides with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity as a potential aid for the prevention and treatment of diabesity, since the mechanisms of action mentioned directly affect oxidative stress and the characteristic imbalance of the inflammatory process of this disease. Some of these studies have demonstrated beneficial results in relation to oxidative stress and proinflammatory markers. However, the role of biopeptides, in relation to oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, remains unclear and represents a potentially fruitful area for further research in the health area.
