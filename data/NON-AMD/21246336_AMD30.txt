Especially when chronic, the presence of a somatic disorder is accompanied by various levels of psychological stress, which can range up to comorbidity with mental disorders. In addition, chronic somatic diseases and mental disorders are often interdependent. Treatment for persons with mental and somatic comorbidity is frequently offered in the context of medical rehabilitation. As skills of psychotherapists are concerned, comorbidity needs a bio-psychosocial approach in which knowledge of medicine, psychology, and social sciences is integrated.

Selected examples for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiovascular disorder and diabetes, respectively, illustrate these aspects.
