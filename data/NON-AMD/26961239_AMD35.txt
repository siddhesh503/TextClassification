Traditional Chinese exercise (TCE) has widespread use for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease; however, there appears to be no consensus about the benefits of TCE for patients with cardiovascular disease. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effects of TCE for patients with cardiovascular disease.
Relevant studies were searched by PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We covered only published articles with randomized controlled trials. The outcome measures included physiological outcomes, biochemical outcomes, physical function, quality of life, and depression. A total of 35 articles with 2249 cardiovascular disease patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. The pooling revealed that TCE could decrease systolic blood pressure by 9.12 mm Hg (95% CI -16.38 to -1.86, P=0.01) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.12 mm Hg (95% CI -7.71 to -2.52, P<0.001). Patients performing TCE also found benefits compared with those in the control group in terms of triglyceride (standardized mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.09, P=0.006), 6-minute walk test (mean difference 59.58 m, 95% CI -153.13 to 269.93, P=0.03), Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire results (mean difference -17.08, 95% CI -23.74 to -10.41, P<0.001), 36-Item Short Form physical function scale (mean difference 0.82, 95% CI 0.32-1.33, P=0.001), and Profile of Mood States depression scale (mean difference -3.02, 95% CI -3.50 to -2.53, P<0.001).
This study demonstrated that TCE can effectively improve physiological outcomes, biochemical outcomes, physical function, quality of life, and depression among patients with cardiovascular disease. More high-quality randomized controlled trials on this topic are warranted.
