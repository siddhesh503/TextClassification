Polyomavirus BK-associated nephropathy (BKAN) is an important mechanism for renal losing after kidney transplantation. It seems that Polyomavirus BK can induce nephropathy by direct cell lysis and stimulation of the immune system and induction of inflammation. CXCL10 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which stimulates the migration and activation of immune cells to the infected sites. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of CXCL10 in the Polyomavirus BK-infected and Polyomavirus BK-non-infected post renal transplanted nephropathic patients in comparison to healthy controls. In this cross-sectional study, Polyomavirus BK-infected post renal transplanted nephropathic patients, Polyomavirus BK-non-infected post renal transplanted nephropathic patients, and healthy controls were enrolled to evaluate mRNA and protein levels of CXCL10 by real-time PCR and ELISA techniques, respectively. mRNA levels of CXCL10 were not significantly different among participants, while serum levels of CXCL10 were significantly elevated in the Polyomavirus BK-infected patients when compared to non-infected patients as well as controls and in non-infected patients when compared to healthy controls. Due to the results, it seems that Polyomavirus BK may potentially induce renal losing through stimulation of inflammation via increasing translation of CXCL10, as a pro-inflammatory chemokine.
