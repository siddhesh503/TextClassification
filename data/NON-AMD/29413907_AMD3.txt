Ophthalmic acid (OPH), γ-glutamyl-L-2-aminobutyryl-glycine, a tripeptide analogue of glutathione (GSH), has recently captured considerable attention as a biomarker of oxidative stress in animals. The OPH and GSH biosynthesis, as well as some biochemical behaviors, are very similar. Here, we sought to investigate the presence of OPH in plants and its possible relationship with GSH, known to possess multiple functions in the plant development, growth and response to environmental changes.
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was used to examine the occurrence of OPH in leaves from various plant species, and flours from several plant seeds. Different types of oxidative stress, i.e., water, dark, paraquat, and cadmium stress, were induced in rye, barley, oat, and winter wheat leaves to evaluate the effects on the levels of OPH and its metabolic precursors.
OPH and its dipeptide precursor, γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyric acid, were found to occur in phylogenetically distant plants. Interestingly, the levels of OPH were tightly associated with the oxidative stress tested. Levels of OPH precursors, γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyric acid and 2-aminobutyric acid, the latter efficiently formed in plants via biosynthetic pathways absent in the animal kingdom, were also found to increase during oxidative stress.
OPH occurs in plants and its levels are tightly associated with oxidative stress.
OPH behaves as an oxidative stress marker and its biogenesis might occur through a biochemical pathway common to many living organisms.
