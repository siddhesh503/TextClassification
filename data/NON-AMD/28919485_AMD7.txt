Autoimmune disease are defined as the attacks on host tissue by the immune system. Several factors, e.g. genetic and environmental triggers (in particular, viruses, bacteria, and other infectious pathogens) play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Bacterial infections are related to several autoimmune diseases, e.g. chronic inflammations and demyelination. Nowadays, an estimated 20-30% of the general human population carry Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This organism can asymptomatically colonize healthy individuals. S. aureus carriers show no sign of infection and can thus spread this bacterium in the community. Several studies investigated the potential involvement of this bacterium as the etiological agents of autoimmune diseases. The present review focused on the role of S. aureus infections in the pathogenesis of autoimmune, inflammatory, and demyelinating diseases. Possible modes of the pathogenic action of bacteria are discussed in association with the ways in which S. aureus can initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity.
