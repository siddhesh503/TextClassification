This study was performed to evaluate the possible protective effect of two calcium channel blocker's "lacidipine (LAC) and amlodipine (AML)" on bone metabolism in an experimental ovariectomized and inflammation-induced osteoporosis rat model (OVXinf). For the purpose of this study, the rats were divided into eight groups, each containing eight rats: sham-operated control (group 1, SH), sham + inflammation (group 2, SHinf), ovariectomy (group 3, OVX), ovariectomy + inflammation (group 4, OVXinf), ovariectomy + LAC 4 mg/kg (group 5, OVX + LAC), ovariectomy + inflammation + LAC 4 mg/kg (group 6, OVXinf + LAC), ovariectomy + AML 5 mg/kg (group 7, OVX + AML), ovariectomy + inflammation + AML 5 mg/kg (group 8, OVXinf + AML). The levels of osteocalcin and osteopontin decreased in OVXinf + LAC and OVXinf + AML groups. The serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were increased significantly in the OVXinf rats compared with the SH group. Gene expression levels of the osteogenic factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and type I collagen 1A1 (Col1A1) significantly decreased in the OVXinf group, when compared with the control group. AML or LAC administrations increased the levels of Runx2 and Col1A1. These results suggest that amlodipine and lacidipine may be a novel therapeutic target for radical osteoporosis treatment in hypertensive patients.
