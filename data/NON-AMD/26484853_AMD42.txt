Metastatic lesions in prostate cancer beyond the bone have prognostic importance and affect clinical therapeutic decisions. Few data exist regarding the prevalence of soft-tissue metastases at the initial diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
This study analyzed 232 men with nonmetastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who developed metastases detected by a bone scan or computed tomography (CT). All bone scans and CT scans within the 30 days before or after the mCRPC diagnosis were reviewed. The rate of soft-tissue metastases among those undergoing CT was determined. Then, predictors of soft-tissue metastases and visceral and lymph node metastases were identified.
Compared with men undergoing CT (n = 118), men undergoing only bone scans (n = 114) were more likely to have received primary treatment (P = .048), were older (P = .013), and less recently developed metastases (P = .018). Among those undergoing CT, 52 (44%) had soft-tissue metastases, including 20 visceral metastases (17%) and 41 lymph node metastases (35%), whereas 30% had no bone involvement. In a univariable analysis, only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predicted soft-tissue metastases (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; P = .047), and no statistically significant predictors of visceral metastases were found. A higher PSA level was associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR, 1.38; P = .014), whereas receiving primary treatment was associated with decreased risk (OR, 0.36; P = .015).
The data suggest that there is a relatively high rate of soft-tissue metastasis (44%) among CRPC patients undergoing CT at the initial diagnosis of metastases, including some men with no bone involvement. Therefore, forgoing CT during a metastatic evaluation may lead to an underdiagnosis of soft-tissue metastases and an underdiagnosis of metastases in general.
