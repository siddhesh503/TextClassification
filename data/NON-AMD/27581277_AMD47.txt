Angelicin, a furocoumarin found in Psoralea corylifolia L. fruit, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effects of angelicin on allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in mice. Mice were sensitized to OVA (on days 0 and 14) and challenged with OVA three times (on days 21 to 23). Angelicin (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 1 h before OVA treatment after the initial OVA sensitization. The production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in BALF and IgE in the serum were measured by ELISA. Lung histological changes were detected by using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. The results showed that angelicin significantly inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration into the lungs. Histological studies showed that angelicin significantly attenuated OVA-induced lung injury. Meanwhile, treatment of angelicin dose-dependently inhibited OVA-induced the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in BALF and IgE in the serum. Furthermore, angelicin was found to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness and NF-kB activation. In conclusion, our results suggested that angelicin inhibited allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by inhibiting NF-kB activation.
