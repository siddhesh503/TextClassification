Large epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate that multiple episodes of acute kidney injury contribute to the development and progression of kidney fibrosis. Although our understanding of kidney fibrosis has improved in the past two decades, we have limited therapeutic strategies to halt its progression. Myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation remain critical to the progression of kidney fibrosis. Although canonical Wnt signaling can trigger the activation of myofibroblasts in the kidney, mediators of Wnt inhibition in the resident progenitor cells are unclear. Recent studies demonstrate that the loss of a Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a kidney-enriched zinc-finger transcription factor, exacerbates kidney fibrosis in murine models. Here, we tested whether Klf15 mRNA and protein expression are reduced in late stages of fibrosis in mice that underwent unilateral ureteric obstruction, a model of progressive renal fibrosis. Knockdown of Klf15 in Foxd1-expressing cells (Foxd1-Cre Klf15fl/fl) increased extracellular matrix deposition and myofibroblast proliferation as compared to wildtype (Foxd1-Cre Klf15+/+) mice after three and seven days of ureteral obstruction. This was validated in mice receiving angiotensin II treatment for six weeks. In both these murine models, the increase in renal fibrosis was found in Foxd1-Cre Klf15<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and accompanied by the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of Klf15 in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts activated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, increased profibrotic transcripts, and increased proliferation after treatment with a Wnt1 ligand. Conversely, the overexpression of KLF15 inhibited phospho-β-catenin (Ser552) expression in Wnt1-treated cells. Thus, KLF15 has a critical role in attenuating kidney fibrosis by inhibiting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
