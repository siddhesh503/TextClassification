Genistein plays an important role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with genistein (10, 100, and 1000 nM) for 6 h and then exposed to ox-LDL (50 mg/L) for another 24 h. Results showed that ox-LDL induced the expressions of E-selectin, P-selectin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin-8, vascular adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which were counteracted by genistein. The inhibitory effect was further enhanced with the augment of genistein (10, 100, and 1000 nM). Further analyses demonstrated the effect of genistein was associated with reducing miR-155 and elevating SOCS1, and miR-155 mimics or SOCS1 siRNA acted similarly in genistein ameliorating inflammation. Moreover, the effect of genistein was accompanied with the inhibition of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway. The present study indicates that genistein could reverse ox-LDL-induced inflammation through miR-155/SOCS1-mediated repression of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway in HUVECs.
