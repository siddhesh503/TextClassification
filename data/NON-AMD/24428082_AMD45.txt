Psychological disturbances play an increasingly important role in the pediatric practice. Since the efficacy of early interventions is well proven, screening instruments are of interest that could help pediatrists with the diagnostic procedure. The authors report on the prevalence of psychological disorders and/or somatoform symptoms with their effects on the psychological and health related quality of life in a consecutive representative pediatric population in a rural area. Altogether 511 children, juveniles and their parents participated in the study. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Health Survey (SF-36) and the Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI) were administered. The results showed that a great percentage of the children and juveniles who did not primarily attend a pediatrist due to behavior problems did exhibit psychological and emotional disturbances. Among the 11- to 17-year-old children the boys were significantly more disturbed than the girls, based on parent ratings. Furthermore, 49% of the children and juveniles reported indications for somatoform disorders, in 7.2% the DSM-IV criteria for a somatization disorder were fulfilled. Girls met the criteria significantly more often than boys. The subjectively perceived quality of life of the children and juveniles was found to be reduced with the degree of the psychological problems and the degree of somatization.
