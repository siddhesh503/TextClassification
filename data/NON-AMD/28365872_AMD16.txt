Obesity is one of the phenotypes of severe asthma, which is considered to be a heterogeneous syndrome; however, its interaction with airway inflammation is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of saturated fatty acids in augmenting airway inflammation induced by house dust mite (HDM) in obesity. Subjects were Balb/c mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks, followed by sensitization and exposure to HDM. Subjects were also administered palmitic acid (PA) for 4 weeks with concurrent sensitization and exposure to HDM. Airway inflammation was assessed by quantifying the amount of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and airway resistance was measured. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages were stimulated by PA. The amount of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) was examined in the supernatant. Compared to normal chow mice, HFD mice underwent significant increases in body weight; increases in number of lung macrophages, including circulating monocytes and alveolar macrophages; and increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total cell count, including neutrophils but not eosinophils, after HDM sensitization and exposure. In vitro, PA induced MCP-1 and augmented LPS-primed production of IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages. Among HDM mice that were administered PA, there was an increase BALF total cell count, including neutrophils but not eosinophils, compared to vehicle mice. In conclusion, saturated fatty acid increased the number of lung macrophages and augmented HDM-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation in a HFD mouse model.
