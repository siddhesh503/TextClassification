Toxic effects of ethylene glycol (EG) and its metabolites are mainly related to metabolic acidosis and kidney damage. EG biotransformation involving CYP2E1 affects the oxidant-antioxidant balance. The study assessed the effect of repeated administration of 4-methylpyrazole (4MP, 15mg/kg b.w. after 2h, followed by 10mg/kg b.w. every 12h) on renal function (creatinine, urea and urinary protein levels) as well as products of kidney's lipid peroxidation (MDA and TBARS levels) in rats poisoned with EG (5745mg/kg b.w.). Serum EG and glycolic acid (GA) concentrations were measured throughout the experiment. Repeated administration of 4MP reduced the rate of EG elimination, extended the period of EG persistence in serum and significantly limited formation of GA. The study showed the temporary intensification of kidney oxidative processes that correlated with changes in kidney function. It was found that the use of 4MP in EG poisoning inhibited its biotransformation to toxic metabolites, but simultaneously intensified oxidative damages in kidneys.
