Oxidative stress induced vascular endothelial cell injure is one of the key and initial event in the development of atherosclerosis. Septin4, as a member of GTP binding protein family, is widely expressed in the eukaryotic cells and considered to be an essential component of the cytoskeleton which is involved in many important physiological processes. However, whether Septin4 is involved in cardiovascular diseases, such as oxidative stress inducted endothelial cell injury still unclear. PARP1 as a DNA repair enzyme can be activated by identifying DNA damaged fragments, which consumes high levels of energy and leads to vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Here, our results first found that Septin4 is involved in oxidative stress induced endothelial cell ROS production and apoptosis through knock-down and over-expression Septin4 approaches. Furthermore, to explore how Septin4 is involved in oxidative stress induced endothelial cells injure, we first identified that Septin4 is a novel PARP1 interacting protein and the interaction is enhanced under oxidative stress. In conclusions, our founding indicates that Septin4 is a novel essential factor involved in oxidative stress induced vascular endothelial cell injury by interacting with apoptosis-related protein PARP1.
