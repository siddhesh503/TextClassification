Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are incurable but suppressible diseases whose molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. In this work, we selected five systemic autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (ATD) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Heterogeneous data such as miRNA, transcription factor (TF), target genes and protein-protein interactions involved in these AIDs were integrated to understand their roles at different functional levels of miRNA such as transcription initiation, gene regulatory network formation and post transcriptional regulation. To understand the functional characteristics of these complex biological networks, they can be simplified as network motifs (sub networks) and motif-motif interacting pairs (MMIs). The network motif patterns and motif-motif interacting pairs that occur for the selected five diseases were identified. To further understand the functional association between AIDs, functions and pathways were determined using gene set enrichment analysis and five selected immune signaling pathways (ISPs). The crosstalk within AIDs and between the immune signaling pathways (ISPs) could provide novel insights in deciphering disease mechanisms. This study represents the first investigation of miRNA-TF regulatory network for AIDs and its association with ISPs using sub-network motifs.
