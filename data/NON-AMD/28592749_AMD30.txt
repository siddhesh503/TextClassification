Revascularization therapy relieves myocardial ischemia, but can also result in ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by oxidative stress. However, the biokinetics of oxidative stress after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion are uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of oxidative stress after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) by measuring urinary biopyrrin levels. Biopyrrin is an oxidative metabolite of bilirubin thought to reflect oxidative stress, along with reactive nitrogen species (RNS).Methods and Results:The study included 18 patients who underwent OPCAB; patients were divided into effort angina pectoris (EAP; n=11) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP; n=7). Urinary biopyrrin and RNS levels were measured during the perioperative period (≤48 h after surgery). Biopyrrin levels transiently increased 4-12 h post-surgery (early phase), followed by a prolonged increase approximately 24-32 h post-surgery (late phase). The delayed increase in biopyrrin tended to be higher in patients with UAP, with a simultaneous increase in RNS. The patients in the UAP group had generally high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), although the cardiac index was within a normal range during the delay phase.
The dynamics of biopyrrin levels revealed a biphasic pattern of oxidative stress after OPCAB. Delayed production of oxidative stress may be influenced by preoperative severity of myocardial ischemia and delayed RNS production.
