Although the female predominance of autoimmune diseases is not completely understood, sex hormones are thought to play a role. Attention to lifelong reproductive health is especially important for women with autoimmune disorders. Many of these women require long-term immunosuppressive therapy that may affect their ability to clear infections, including viruses, and may alter natural tumor surveillance mechanisms. As a result, women with autoimmune diseases may have different risks for common reproductive-related malignancies that may in turn affect screening guidelines and other preventive measures, including vaccination. Women with autoimmune diseases need to adhere diligently to screening recommendations.
