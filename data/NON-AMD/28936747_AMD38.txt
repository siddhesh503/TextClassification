Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally with an estimated 7.4 million people dying from coronary heart disease. Studies have been conducted to identify the therapeutic utility of exosomes in many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. It has been demonstrated that exosomes are immune modulators, can be used to treat cardiac ischemic injury, pulmonary hypertension and many other diseases, including cancers. Exosomes can be used as a biomarker for disease and cell-free drug delivery system for targeting the cells. Many studies suggest that exosomes can be used as a cell-free vaccine for many diseases. In this chapter, we explore the possibility of future therapeutic potential of exosomes in various cardiovascular diseases.
