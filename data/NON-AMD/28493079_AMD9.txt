Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate pattern recognition receptors that play a critical role in allergic inflammation, yet their contribution to autophagy in asthma remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway-mediated autophagy in ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation in mice. Wild-type (WT) and TLR2-knockout (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>) C57BL/6 mice were ovalbumin-sensitized and ovalbumin-challenged. In ovalbumin-challenged WT mice, enhanced expression of TLR2 in lung tissue, remarkable inflammatory cell infiltrates, goblet cell hyperplasia, and increased mucus production were observed. The number of inflammatory cells and interleukin-13 (IL-13) levels increased, while interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) levels decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Expression of PI3K, phospho-Akt, Beclin-1 and LC3-II was enhanced significantly. These changes were mitigated dose-dependently in 3-methyl adenine-treated mice. In contrast, similar but weaker changes were found in ovalbumin-challenged TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and the changes were not significantly attenuated by 3-methyl adenine treatment. These results indicate that TLR2 confers a pivotal role in allergic airway inflammation via regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related autophagy in mice.
