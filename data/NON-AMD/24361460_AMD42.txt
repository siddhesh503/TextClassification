Obesity, characterized by low grade inflammation, induces adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration in white adipose tissue (AT) in both humans and rodents, thus contributing to insulin resistance. Previous studies have shown altered prolactin secretion in obesity, however, studies linking ATM infiltration and prolactin (PRL) secretion to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes are lacking.
In vivo, qPCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that prolactin expression was increased in AT of obese rats and also in human AT from obese, obese pre-diabetic and obese diabetic compared to lean counterparts. Immunohistochemistry of obese rat and human AT sections demonstrated a specific expression of prolactin in macrophages. In vitro, we demonstrated that hyperglycemia and inflammation stimulated macrophages (human THP-1 cell line and sorted rat ATM) to express PRL, when challenged with different glucose concentrations with or without IL1Î². In in vivo and in vitro experiments, we assessed the expression of Pit-1 (PRL-specific transcription factor) and found that its expression was parallel to PRL expression.
In this study, we show that rodent and human macrophages synthesize prolactin in response to inflammation and high glucose concentrations.
Our data shed new light on the potential role of macrophages in the physiopathology of diabesity via the PRL expression and on its expression mechanism and regulation.
