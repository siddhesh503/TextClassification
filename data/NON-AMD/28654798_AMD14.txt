Chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) are a global health problem. Besides diverse leading reasons in initiation and progression of CKDs, it is evident that they might largely originate from changes in the gut microbial community (microbiota). Mounting evidence indicates that a bidirectional relationship exists between host and microbiome in humans and animals with CKDs. Changes in the microbiota composition and structure (dysbiosis) produce excessive amounts of uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate and trimethylamine-N-oxide) but less reno-protective metabolites that are implicated in oxidative stress, uremia, inflammation, deterioration of kidney function, kidney diseases progression, a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk, and mortality in patients with CKD. The present review focuses on the pathogenic association between gut microbiota and kidney diseases like CKD, IgA nephropathy, and kidney stone disease. Certainly, novel insights into the impact of the gut microbiota in kidney diseases can be helpful to develop therapeutic strategies in order to avoid and/or treat aforementioned conditions.
