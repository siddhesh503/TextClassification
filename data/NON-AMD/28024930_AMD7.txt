Kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis marks risk for allograft failure in kidney transplant recipients, but is poorly captured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Whether urinary markers of tubulointerstitial fibrosis can noninvasively identify risk for allograft failure above and beyond eGFR and ACR is unknown.
Case-cohort study.
The FAVORIT (Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction in Transplantation) Trial was a randomized double-blind trial testing vitamin therapy to lower homocysteine levels in stable kidney transplant recipients. We selected a subset of participants at random (n=491) and all individuals with allograft failure during follow-up (cases; n=257).
Using spot urine specimens from the baseline visit, we measured 4 urinary proteins known to correlate with tubulointerstitial fibrosis on biopsy (urine Î±<sub>1</sub>-microglobulin [A1M], monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], and procollagen type III and type I amino-terminal amino pro-peptide).
Death-censored allograft failure.
In models adjusted for demographics, chronic kidney disease risk factors, eGFR, and ACR, higher concentrations of urine A1M (HR per doubling, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.43-2.08) and MCP-1 (HR per doubling, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.32-1.93) were strongly associated with allograft failure. When additionally adjusted for concentrations of other urine fibrosis and several urine injury markers, urine A1M (HR per doubling, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.44]) and MCP-1 levels (HR per doubling, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.89) remained associated with allograft failure. Urine procollagen type III and type I levels were not associated with allograft failure.
We lack kidney biopsy data, BK titers, and HLA antibody status.
Urine measurement of tubulointerstitial fibrosis may provide a noninvasive method to identify kidney transplant recipients at higher risk for future allograft failure, above and beyond eGFR and urine ACR.
