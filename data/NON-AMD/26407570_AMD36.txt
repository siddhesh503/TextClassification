This study determined whether FCGR3B copy number variations (CNVs) were associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.
A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association between FCGR3B CNVs and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases by comparing low FCGR3B CN (<2 to ≥2) and high FCGR3B CN (>2 to ≤2).
In all, 28 comparative studies from 15 reports involving 12,160 patients and 11,103 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between low FCGR3B CN and autoimmune diseases (OR=1.496, 95% CI=1.301-1.716, p=1.0×10(-9)). Subgroup analysis according to ethnicity indicated an association between low FCGR3B CN and autoimmune diseases in Caucasians (OR=1.482, 95% CI=1.219-1.801, p=7.7×10(-6)) and Asians (OR=1.498, 95% CI=1.306-1.717, p=1.0×10(-9)). Meta-analysis according to the type of autoimmune disease indicated a significant association of low FCGR3B CN with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OR=1.797, 95% CI=1.562-2.068, p<1.0×10(-9)), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS; OR=2.263, 95% CI=1.316-3.892, p=0.003), and Wegener's granulomatosis (WG; OR=1.973, 95% CI=1.178-3.302, p=0.010), but not with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; OR=1.333, 95% CI=0.947-1.877, p=0.099). However, the meta-analysis showed no association between high FCGR3B CN and SLE, RA, pSS, and WG.
Thus, the results of this meta-analysis indicated that low FCGR3B CN increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, especially SLE, pSS, and WG.
