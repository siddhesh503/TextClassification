Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the major cause of treatment failure in individuals who undergo surgery for retinal detachment. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells contributes to the pathogenesis of PVR. Oxidative stress is thought to play a role in the progression of retinal diseases including PVR. We have now examined the effects of oxidative stress on the EMT and related processes in the human RPE cell line. We found that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> induced the contraction of RPE cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel. Analysis of a cytokine array revealed that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> specifically increased the release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from RPE cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses showed that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> increased the expression of MIF in RPE cells. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> upregulated the expression of Î±-SMA and vimentin and downregulated that of ZO-1 and N-cadherin. Consistent with these observations, the transepithelial electrical resistance of cell was reduced by exposure to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . The effects of oxidative stress on EMT-related and junctional protein expression as well as on transepithelial electrical resistance were inhibited by antibodies to MIF, but they were not mimicked by treatment with recombinant MIF. Finally, analysis with a profiling array for mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling revealed that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> specifically induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Our results thus suggest that MIF may play a role in induction of the EMT and related processes by oxidative stress in RPE cells and that it might thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of PVR. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is a major complication of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and both oxidative stress and induction of the EMT in RPE cells are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. We have now examined the effects of oxidative stress on the EMT and related processes in the human RPE cell line ARPE19. Our results thus implicate MIF in induction of the EMT and related processes by oxidative stress in RPE cells and the regulated expression of EMT markers. They further suggest that MIF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PVR.
