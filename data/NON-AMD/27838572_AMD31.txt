Given that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with impaired quality of life (QoL) and functioning, it is important examine whether therapeutic recovery from OCD leads to improvements on these important secondary outcomes. Only a few studies have examined how measures of OCD symptom severity relate to QoL and functioning among patients receiving treatment for OCD.
OCD severity was measured with the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), a self-report scale of OCD, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), an interview measure of OCD. Participants were 100 adults with a primary diagnosis of OCD on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing SRI augmentation with either exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) therapy, risperidone, or pill placebo. At baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment, patients completed assessments for OCD symptoms and QoL/functioning measures. Multilevel modeling was used to assess changes in QoL/functioning over the course of treatment and to compare such changes across treatment conditions.
Improvements in QoL/functioning were significantly greater among those receiving EX/RP compared to those receiving risperidone. Compared to pill placebo, EX/RP performed better on measures of functioning but not QoL. Greater improvement in individual OCI-R scores was associated with greater improvements in QoL/functioning, regardless of condition. In addition, Y-BOCS scores appeared to moderate improvements in QoL over the course of all treatment conditions, such that those with higher Y-BOCS scores showed the greatest improvements in QoL over time.
Improvements in QoL/functioning were associated with reduction in OCD symptom severity. The implications on OCD treatment and clinical research are discussed.
