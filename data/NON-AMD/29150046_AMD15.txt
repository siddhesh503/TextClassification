Preterm birth infants are more susceptible to oxidative stress and aftermaths unwanted outcomes such as DNA damage due to hyperoxic stress. In this study, we compared the DNA strand breaks as one of the results of DNA oxidation in white blood cells, malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker), catalase and superoxide dismutase activity, and total antioxidant capacity (markers of antioxidant defense) in a cord blood plasma of a group of preterm (n=25) and full term births (n=25). The primary DNA damage and plasma oxidative stress markers were significantly higher in a preterm group (p<0.05). Cord plasma activity of superoxide dismutase was significantly lower in preterm infants (pâ‰¤0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the cord blood total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity and malondialdehyde in preterm and term infants. Among the oxidative stress markers, the malondialdehyde concentration showed the strongest effect size (1.54; 95%CI: 0.9-2.17). For comet parameters, the most powerful effect size was observed for tail length (5.24; 95% CI: 4.05-6.42). However, tail DNA percent and tail moment were also significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Significant negative correlation was observed between comet assay parameters and birth weight and gestational age when all cases and controls entered into the analysis. There was no significant association between the levels of oxidative stress markers and early DNA damage in cord blood plasma with future nutritional tolerance in preterm infants. In the present study, the primary DNA damage and plasma oxidative stress markers significantly were increased in a preterm group. Preterm babies are more prone to the outcomes related to the early DNA damage. Tail DNA percent does not depend on experimental conditions as other parameters (tail length and thus also tail moment) and can be used for comparison with other studies.
