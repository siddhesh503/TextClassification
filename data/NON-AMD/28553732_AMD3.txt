Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence indicates that HIF-1α is associated with the inflammation and pathologic activities of autoimmune diseases. Areas covered: Considering that the types of autoimmune diseases are complicated and various, this review aims to cover the typical kinds of autoimmune diseases, discuss the molecular mechanisms, biological functions and expression of HIF-1α in these diseases, and further explore its therapeutic potential. Expert opinion: Inflammation and hypoxia are interdependent. HIF-1α as a key regulator of hypoxia, exerts a crucial role in the balance between Th17 and Treg, and involves in the inflammation and pathologic activities of autoimmune diseases. Although there are many challenges remaining to be overcome, targeting HIF-1α could be a promising strategy for autoimmune diseases therapies.
